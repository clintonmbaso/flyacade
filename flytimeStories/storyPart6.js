Wiggly was always eager to explore new places, while Squirmy liked to think carefully about their adventures. Every day, they looked forward to discovering new things in their garden world.</p>
<p>One morning, the sun was shining brightly, and Wiggly and Squirmy decided it was the perfect day for an adventure. They wriggled out of their snug burrows and into the warm soil. As they traveled through the garden, they marveled at the beautiful flowers and listened to the cheerful songs of the birds.</p>
<p>Soon, they came across a large <span class="interactive" data-info="Compost: A pile of organic matter that provides nutrients to the soil.">pile of compost</span> that smelled quite interesting. The compost was full of old leaves and bits of plants, and it was covered with tiny, wriggling insects. Wiggly’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he imagined all the secrets that might be hidden inside.</p>
<p>Squirmy, on the other hand, was curious but cautious. “Look at all this rich compost, Wiggly,” he said. “It’s great for making the soil even healthier. Let’s dig around and see what we can find!” The two worms began to dig through the compost, their little tails wriggling with anticipation.</p>
<p>As they explored the compost pile, they suddenly found something shiny buried beneath the soil.

<h3>2: The Wise Old Worm</h3>
<p>Wiggly and Squirmy were thrilled with their shiny coin and decided to visit the Wise Old Worm to learn more about it. The Wise Old Worm was very wise and knew a lot about the garden and its secrets. His burrow was located under a huge, old oak tree, which was a very special place in the garden.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Wise Old Worm’s home, they saw him resting on a bed of soft, green leaves. The Wise Old Worm was known for his kindness and wisdom, and he welcomed Wiggly and Squirmy with a warm smile. They showed him the shiny coin and asked, “Can you tell us what this coin is and if it means anything special?”</p>
<p>The Wise Old Worm carefully looked at the coin and said, “Ah, this is an ancient coin from long ago. It’s very special because it is said to bring good luck to those who find it. There is a legend that this coin can lead to a great adventure if used wisely. It might be the key to something amazing!”</p>
<p>Wiggly and Squirmy listened with wide eyes, imagining all the exciting possibilities. The Wise Old Worm gave them a special map with symbols that would help them on their journey.

<p>Feeling even more excited about their adventure, Wiggly and Squirmy thanked the Wise Old Worm and prepared for their journey. They packed their tiny backpacks with snacks and other important things they might need. The next morning, they set off, ready to follow the map and discover the amazing adventure the coin promised.</p>

<h3>3: The Hidden Clues</h3>
<p>Wiggly and Squirmy started their journey with the special map from the Wise Old Worm. The map had strange symbols and arrows that showed them where to go. The first clue on the map was hidden near a big, colorful flower garden. Wiggly and Squirmy followed the directions carefully, excited to see what they would find.</p>
<p>As they wriggled through the flower garden, they noticed a large, flat stone with some markings on it. It looked like part of a puzzle. Wiggly pointed at the stone and said, “This must be the first clue from the map!” They carefully read the markings and tried to solve the riddle written on the stone. The riddle talked about finding a special place under the shade of a big tree.</p>
<p>Following the clue, they made their way to a giant willow tree with long, drooping branches. The tree looked very old and magical, and its branches seemed to whisper in the wind. Wiggly and Squirmy looked around the tree’s base and found a hidden entrance to a dark tunnel. The entrance was covered in soft moss and had a faint, glowing light coming from inside.</p>
<p>Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, they decided to go into the tunnel. The inside was dark but filled with tiny, sparkling stones that glowed softly. They walked carefully, with the light from the glowing stones guiding their way. As they moved further into the tunnel, they saw more clues and signs on the walls, leading them deeper into the adventure.</p>
<p>At the end of the tunnel, they found a large, wooden door with a special lock. The map showed a pattern that matched the lock, and Wiggly and Squirmy worked together to unlock it. When the door opened, they found a room filled with magical items and another clue that would lead them to the next part of their adventure. They were thrilled and ready to continue their journey, eager to see what was next.</p>

<h3>4: Preparing for the Journey</h3>
<p>After finding the magical room with the next clue, Wiggly and Squirmy knew they needed to get ready for a big adventure. They went back to their cozy burrows to gather everything they might need for their journey. Wiggly was busy packing snacks like tiny crumbs of bread and bits of fresh leaves, while Squirmy carefully made a list of supplies to bring.</p>
<p>Squirmy decided they would need a few more things to help them on their way. He packed a tiny flashlight to help them see in dark places, a small notebook to keep track of clues, and a map with important markings. Wiggly added a few favorite treats, just in case they got hungry along the way.</p>
<p>Before they left, they visited their friends in the garden to say goodbye. They told their friends about the adventure they were about to embark on and showed them the shiny coin and the special map. Everyone was excited and wished them good luck. Their friends promised to keep an eye out for any more clues that might appear in the garden.</p>
<p>With everything packed and their friends' encouragement in their hearts, Wiggly and Squirmy set out early the next morning. The sun was just rising, casting a warm, golden light over the garden.

Its branches were wide and its leaves were thick, creating a nice shady area. They decided this must be the place they were looking for.</p>
<p>Under the oak tree, they searched carefully and found a small, hidden box buried in the soil. The box was old and covered with bits of dirt and leaves.
