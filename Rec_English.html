                           <br>
Materials Needed:<br>
1. Large flashcards with pictures of objects starting with the letter A (e.g., apple, ant, astronaut)<br>
2. Alphabet chart<br>
3. Whiteboard and markers<br>
4. Paper and crayons<br>
5. Storybook with a focus on the letter A (e.g., &quot;The Ants Go Marching&quot;)<br>
                           <br>
Lesson Duration: Approximately 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Procedure:<br>
                           <br>
1. Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Gather students in a circle and begin with a brief discussion about the alphabet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Show the alphabet chart and point out the letter A.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ask students if they know any words that start with the letter A. Encourage participation and write down their responses on the whiteboard.<br>
                           <br>
2. Introducing the Sound of Letter A (10 minutes):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Use flashcards to show pictures of objects that start with the letter A (e.g., apple, ant).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Pronounce the name of each object and emphasize the beginning sound (/a/).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Have students repeat the sound after you, emphasizing the /a/ sound.<br>
                           <br>
3. Phonics Activity (15 minutes):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Engage students in a fun phonics activity. Give each student a piece of paper and crayons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ask them to draw pictures of objects that start with the letter A. Walk around and provide assistance as needed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once they finish drawing, have each student share their drawings with the class and say the name of the object, emphasizing the /a/ sound.<br>
                           <br>
4. Story Time (10 minutes):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Read a storybook that features words beginning with the letter A (e.g., &quot;The Ants Go Marching&quot;).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Pause occasionally to ask students questions related to the letter A, such as, &quot;Can you find the word that starts with the letter A?&quot; or &quot;What sound does the word 'ant' start with?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Encourage active listening and participation throughout the story.<br>
                           <br>
5. Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Review the sound of the letter A with the class. Point to the letter A on the alphabet chart and have students say the sound again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Summarize what they have learned about the letter A and its sound.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provide positive reinforcement and praise for their participation and efforts during the lesson.<br>
                           <br>
Extension Activity (Optional):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - If time permits, you can engage students in a letter A scavenger hunt around the classroom or school, where they search for objects that start with the letter A.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Alternatively, you can incorporate a letter A song or chant to reinforce the sound of the letter A.<br>
                           <br>
Assessment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Informal assessment can be done throughout the lesson by observing students' ability to recognize and produce the /a/ sound.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Additionally, you can assess their understanding through participation in activities and their ability to identify words that start with the letter A.<br>
