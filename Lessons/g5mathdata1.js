Mapping refers to a way of showing how elements from one set correspond to elements in another set. Relations show how two things are connected or related in some way.

For example, if you have a set of animals (dog, cat, bird) and a set of sounds (bark, meow, chirp), the students should match each animal to its corresponding sound. Show a few examples on the board.<br><br>Then, explain relation problems, where one set of objects or numbers corresponds to another set in a specific way.
