The arrangement of utensils, plates, and glasses plays a key role in making the dining experience both functional and pleasing to the eye. In a formal setting, every piece has a specific purpose and place.<br><br><b>Key Elements in Table Setting</b>:<br><br><b>1. Side Plate:</b> The side plate is used for bread or rolls and placed to the left of the main plate. This plate should always be aligned with the edge of the table, making it easy to access without disturbing other items.<br><br><b>2. Glasses:</b> The glasses are placed to the right of the plate, above the knife, in a line. The arrangement depends on the type of drink being served (water, wine, etc.). A glass for water is generally placed at the top right of the main plate, and wine glasses are arranged further to the right, slightly staggered.",

It should be positioned just above the knife, within easy reach of the guest.<br><br><b>Wine Glasses:</b> For formal settings with wine, place the wine glasses to the right of the water glass. Red wine glasses are placed lower and white wine glasses higher.<br><br><b>Multiple Glasses:</b> If multiple types of glasses are needed (e.g., for juice, wine, or champagne), space them evenly in a slightly staggered arrangement to ensure there’s enough room for all glasses.",
      "<b>Part 4: Aesthetic and Functional Considerations</b>:<br><br>A good table setting isn’t only about correct placement—it’s also about maintaining balance and elegance.
