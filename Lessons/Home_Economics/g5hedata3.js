      "<b>Introduction to Ventilation:</b><br>Ventilation is the process of allowing fresh air to enter and circulate within a space, like a room or building. It helps keep the air clean by removing stale air, odors, and harmful substances, ensuring a healthy living environment.",
      "<b>Why is Fresh Air Important?</b><br>Fresh air provides the oxygen we need to breathe, supports brain function, and helps reduce indoor pollutants. It minimizes the risk of respiratory problems and improves overall well-being by keeping the air clean and fresh.",
      "<b>Methods of Ventilation:</b><br>1. <b>Natural Ventilation:</b> Opening windows and doors allows fresh air to flow in and stale air to exit. This is simple, effective, and free.<br>2. <b>Mechanical Ventilation:</b> Using fans or air conditioners helps circulate air, especially when windows cannot be opened.<br>3. <b>Cross Ventilation:</b> Positioning openings on opposite sides of a room allows air to flow through, cooling and freshening the space.<br>4. <b>Ventilators and Air Ducts:</b> Common in larger buildings, they help distribute fresh air evenly while removing stale air efficiently.",
      "<b>Dangers of Poor Ventilation:</b><br>1. <b>Shortage of Clean Air:</b> Poor ventilation leads to stuffy rooms with low oxygen, making it uncomfortable to breathe.<br>2. <b>Spread of Diseases:</b> Airborne diseases can linger in poorly ventilated spaces, increasing the risk of infections.<br>3. <b>Harmful Gases:</b> Accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide poses serious health risks.<br>4. <b>Mold and Allergies:</b> Moist, poorly ventilated areas can foster mold growth, which triggers allergies and respiratory issues.",
      "<b>Exercise:</b><br>1. What is ventilation?<br>2. Name two methods of natural ventilation.<br>3. Why is fresh air important for our health?<br>4. What is one danger of poor ventilation?<br>5. Circle the correct answer: Poor ventilation can lead to (better air quality / the spread of diseases).<br>6. How does cross ventilation work?<br>7. True or False: Overcrowding helps improve air quality.<br>8. What should you avoid using indoors to maintain good air quality?<br>9. Name one way to achieve good ventilation in the morning.<br>10. Write a sentence explaining why it is important to open windows regularly."
