    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Cooking Methods (Frying and Baking)</b>:<br><br>Definition of Frying: Frying is a method of cooking where food is immersed in hot oil or fat. It can be done by deep frying (submerging food in hot oil) or pan frying (cooking in a small amount of oil in a pan). This method results in crispy, golden food.<br><br>Definition of Baking: Baking is a method of cooking food using dry heat in an oven. It uses indirect heat and is typically used for foods like cakes, cookies, bread, and casseroles.<br><br>Key Differences: Frying involves oil or fat to cook the food, while baking uses dry heat from an oven. Frying gives food a crispy texture, while baking tends to make food more evenly cooked and soft.",
      "<b>Part 2: Demonstration of Frying</b>:<br><br>Materials Needed: Frying pan or deep fryer, oil (vegetable, olive, or canola oil), food to fry (e.g., chicken, potatoes, or dough for fritters), tongs or a slotted spoon, paper towels for draining excess oil.<br><br>Step-by-Step Process: Heat the oil in a pan or fryer until it reaches the appropriate temperature (about 350°F/175°C for deep frying). Carefully place the food in the hot oil. Be cautious of splashing oil. Fry the food until it is golden brown and crispy. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the food from the oil and place it on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.<br><br>Safety Tip: Always be careful when working with hot oil. Never leave hot oil unattended, and use tools like tongs to handle food in the oil.",
      "<b>Part 3: Demonstration of Baking</b>:<br><br>Materials Needed: Oven, baking tray or dish, parchment paper (optional), food to bake (e.g., cookies, cake, or bread), oven mitts.<br><br>Step-by-Step Process: Preheat the oven to the required temperature (typically between 350°F and 375°F for most baked goods). Prepare the food by following the recipe (e.g., placing dough on a baking sheet). Place the baking tray or dish in the preheated oven. Bake for the recommended time (check the recipe for exact time). Once done, remove the food from the oven using oven mitts and allow it to cool.<br><br>Safety Tip: Always use oven mitts when handling hot trays or dishes from the oven. Be cautious of the oven's hot temperature.",
      "<b>Part 4: Health Considerations and Benefits</b>:<br><br>Frying: While frying adds flavor and a crispy texture, it can also add a lot of calories and fat to food, especially if the food absorbs a lot of oil. Tips for healthier frying include using less oil, opting for healthier oils like olive oil, and draining fried foods well on paper towels to reduce oil content.<br><br>Baking: Baking tends to be a healthier cooking method because it uses little to no added fats and often results in less greasy food. Baking also preserves the nutrients in the food better than frying.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise and Practical Activity</b>:<br><br>Activity 1 - Frying: Divide the class into small groups and have them fry simple items like potatoes or dough for fritters (using a preheated fryer or pan under supervision).

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Table Manners</b>:<br><br>In this section, we will discuss the concept of table manners and why they are important. Table manners are the behaviors that help us eat in a polite and respectful way. Good table manners show respect for the people around us, make meals more enjoyable, and help us create a positive impression in social settings.",
      "<b>Part 2: Manners to Avoid at the Table</b>:<br><br>Let’s review some behaviors that should be avoided while eating:<br>1. Speaking with food in the mouth: It is considered impolite to talk with food in your mouth. This can be unpleasant for others, and it may cause accidents like choking.<br>Tip: Finish chewing before talking.<br>2. Opening the mouth when chewing: Chewing with your mouth open can be noisy and distracting to others. It also looks unpleasant.<br>Tip: Keep your mouth closed while chewing.<br>3. Playing while eating: Eating is a time to focus on the food and the people you are with. Playing, making noise, or engaging in distracting activities can disrupt the meal.<br>Tip: Be focused on your meal and enjoy it quietly.",
      "<b>Part 3: Positive Table Manners to Practice</b>:<br><br>Now that we know what not to do, let's focus on good habits to practice while eating:<br>1. Using utensils properly: Always use forks, knives, and spoons correctly. Hold them gently and use them for their intended purpose (fork for eating, knife for cutting, spoon for soups).<br>2. Chewing with your mouth closed: As mentioned before, chewing with your mouth closed is polite and helps make the dining experience pleasant for everyone.<br>3. Sitting up straight: Good posture shows respect for others and helps with digestion. Sit at the table with your back straight and feet flat on the floor.<br>4. Offering food to others: When you’re at the table, be kind and offer food to others before serving yourself. This shows consideration for others.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Importance of Table Manners in Different Situations</b>:<br><br>Good table manners are essential not only at home but also in public places, such as restaurants, parties, and at school events. Having good table manners can help you make a great impression, gain the respect of others, and avoid embarrassing situations. It can also lead to more enjoyable meals with family and friends.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sources of Flour</b>:<br><br>Sources of Flour:<br>Wheat: This is the most common type of flour used in baking and cooking. It is milled into various grades, such as whole wheat flour and refined flour.<br>Maize (corn): This flour is made from dried maize kernels and is used to make products like cornbread and tortillas.<br>Cassava: A root vegetable that is processed into cassava flour, commonly used in gluten-free baking.<br>Sorghum: A grain that is milled into flour and is often used for gluten-free recipes.<br>Millet: A small, round grain that can be ground into flour for gluten-free baking.<br>Soya: Flour made from soybeans, often used for its high protein content.<br><br>Activity: Display samples of different types of flour. Discuss their uses and where they come from. Ask students to share what they know about different types of flour.",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding Yeast</b>:<br><br>What is Yeast?<br>Yeast is a microorganism used in baking. It is responsible for making dough rise by producing carbon dioxide gas, which makes the dough light and airy.<br><br>There are different types of yeast: active dry yeast, instant yeast, and fresh yeast. For this lesson, we will use active dry yeast.<br><br>How Yeast Works:<br>When mixed with water and sugar, yeast ferments, producing carbon dioxide and alcohol. The carbon dioxide gets trapped in the dough, causing it to rise.<br>Yeast helps in the preparation of baked goods like buns, fritters, bread, and cakes.<br><br>Activity: Show the students a packet of yeast. Demonstrate how to activate yeast by mixing it with warm water and a pinch of sugar. Let the mixture bubble and foam, showing how yeast produces gas.",
      "<b>Part 3: Flour Mixtures Using Yeast – Buns and Fritters</b>:<br><br>Buns:<br>Ingredients: Flour, yeast, sugar, salt, water, butter, and eggs.<br>Method: Combine the ingredients, knead the dough, allow it to rise, and then bake until golden brown.<br>Key Points: Proper kneading and allowing the dough to rise are crucial to make fluffy buns.<br><br>Fritters:<br>Ingredients: Flour, yeast, water, salt, sugar, and optional fillings (like vegetables, fruit, or meat).<br>Method: Mix the ingredients into a thick batter, fry in hot oil until golden and crispy.<br>Key Points: Fritters should be fried at the right temperature to avoid being soggy or burnt.<br><br>Activity: Show a video or live demonstration of how to prepare dough for buns and fritters. Allow students to ask questions during the demonstration.",
      "<b>Part 4: Key Baking Tips</b>:<br><br>Kneading the Dough: Kneading helps develop gluten, making the dough elastic and smooth.<br>Allowing the Dough to Rise: Yeast needs time to work. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour before baking.<br>Frying Temperature: For fritters, the oil should be hot enough to cook the batter quickly, ensuring they are crispy on the outside and soft inside.<br><br>Activity: Allow students to practice kneading dough (if materials are available) or perform a hands-on activity like shaping buns for baking.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>1. Discussion Questions:<br>What are the different sources of flour? Can you name a dish made from each type of flour?<br>How does yeast make dough rise? Why is it important in baking?<br>What are the key steps to making buns and fritters with yeast?<br><br>2. Practical Activity:<br>Students will be divided into small groups and given materials to prepare a simple dough for buns or fritters (either by hand or with teacher guidance). Each group will prepare their dough, allowing it to rise and then either bake buns or prepare fritter batter for frying.<br>Reflection: After the activity, students will discuss the process and results, explaining what worked well and what they would change next time.<br><br>3. Homework: Write a short paragraph explaining how yeast is used in baking and why it is important. Include one recipe you would like to try at home that uses yeast."
