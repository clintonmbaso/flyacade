What was it?'",

If you have 10 coins and you group them into sets of 10, how many groups will you have? What if you have 50 coins or 100 coins?' <br><br>2.

Write a number that ends in 0 and explain how you know it can be divided by 10.<br>4. True or False: '30 is divisible by 10.' '47 is divisible by 10.'<br>5.

Lily is wearing a red hat, Ben is sitting under the tree, and Emma has a blue bag. Who is sitting next to Emma?'<br><br>Ask the students: What do you think? How do we figure it out?",
      "<b>Part 3: Discussing How to Use Clues</b>:<br><br>Guide the class in using the clues logically. For the example above, the clues are:<br><br>Lily is wearing a red hat.<br>Ben is sitting under the tree.<br>Emma has a blue bag.<br><br>The conclusion: Since Lily is not sitting under the tree, and Ben is sitting under the tree, it must be Lily who is sitting next to Emma.<br><br>Explain that by looking at each clue and using what they know, they can solve the puzzle.",
      "<b>Part 4: Walkthrough of Another Example</b>:<br><br>Present another simple story or puzzle, helping the students think through the clues together. For example:<br><br>Story:<br>'Tim, Jack, and Kate each have a pet. Tim's pet is a bird, Jack’s pet is a dog, and Kate’s pet is a fish. Who is allergic to animals with fur?'<br><br>Help the students use the clues to deduce the answer: Jack has the dog (fur), so Tim or Kate must be allergic. Since Tim has a bird, the answer is Kate has the fish, so Tim is likely allergic to fur.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Create Your Own Puzzle</b>:<br><br>For the final activity, challenge the students to create their own story-based deductive problem. Prompt them with an example to guide their thinking, such as:<br><br>'I have a red ball, a green ball, and a blue ball. The red ball is on the table, the green ball is under the chair, and the blue ball is in the box. Which ball is on the table?'<br><br>Students can then draw or write their own puzzles and share them with the class, using clues to help others solve the mystery."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Deductive Reasoning</b>:<br><br>Start by explaining what deductive reasoning is:<br>'Deductive reasoning means using facts or rules that we know are true to figure out new things. It's like solving a mystery by looking at the clues and making a decision based on them.'<br><br>Give an example:<br>'If all apples are fruits, and all fruits grow on trees, do apples grow on trees? Yes, because apples are fruits, and fruits grow on trees.'<br><br>Discuss the logical steps in the example: 'We know apples are fruits. We know fruits grow on trees. So, we can decide that apples grow on trees.'",
      "<b>Part 2: Problem-Solving Scenarios</b>:<br><br>Provide simple problem-solving scenarios that require deductive reasoning. Present the problems one at a time, and guide the students through each:<br><br>Scenario 1:<br>'If all cats are animals and animals need food to survive, do cats need food to survive?'<br><br>Ask students to think about the relationship between cats, animals, and food. Guide them to recognize that since all animals need food, cats must also need food.<br><br>Scenario 2:<br>'If all flowers need sunlight to grow, and roses are flowers, do roses need sunlight to grow?'<br><br>Encourage students to reason step by step: 'We know flowers need sunlight. Roses are flowers, so roses must also need sunlight.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Group Activity: Solving Problems Together</b>:<br><br>Divide the students into small groups. Give each group a set of similar problems where they must apply deductive reasoning. For example:<br><br>Problem 1:<br>'If all birds can fly and sparrows are birds, can sparrows fly?'<br><br>Let students discuss in their groups and share their answers with the class.<br><br>Problem 2:<br>'If all fruits are healthy and bananas are fruits, are bananas healthy?'<br><br>Have students solve this problem together, ensuring they follow logical steps to reach the correct conclusion.",
      "<b>Part 4: Discuss the Importance of Deductive Reasoning</b>:<br><br>After the group activity, lead a class discussion on why deductive reasoning is helpful in everyday life. Examples:<br>'We use deductive reasoning when we make decisions, like choosing the right clothes based on the weather. If it’s cold and I know that coats keep me warm, I can decide to wear a coat.'<br><br>Ask students: 'What else do you think you use deductive reasoning for in your daily lives?'",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Task Reflection</b>:<br><br>For the task, ask students to reflect on how deductive reasoning helps them solve problems. They should write examples from their daily lives where they used reasoning to make decisions.<br><br>Provide a few prompts to help them:<br>'What do you do when you know you have homework and you need a pencil to finish it?'<br>'If you know the sun is out and it's warm, what can you decide to wear?'<br><br>After they've written their examples, let them share a few with the class."
