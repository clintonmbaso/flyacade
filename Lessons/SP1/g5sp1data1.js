      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Cause and Effect</b>:<br><br>Explain the concept: Start by explaining that cause and effect refers to how one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect).<br><br>Example: You can give an example such as, 'If we eat too much candy (cause), we might get a stomach ache (effect).'<br><br>Key points to cover:<br>Cause: The event or action that happens first.<br>Effect: The result or outcome that happens because of the cause.<br><br>Use a simple diagram on the board to illustrate: Cause → Effect.",
      "<b>Part 2: Video Demonstration</b>:<br><br>Activity: Show a short video (5-7 minutes) that demonstrates cause and effect in different scenarios.<br><br>Example scenarios in the video could include:<br>'What happens if we drop an object?' (cause: dropping the object → effect: the object falls to the ground).<br>'What happens if we water a plant regularly?' (cause: watering the plant → effect: the plant grows).<br><br>Discussion: After the video, ask the students to recall the cause and effect examples from the video. Encourage them to identify both the cause and the effect for each scenario.",

(Cause: forgetting sunscreen → Effect: getting sunburned).<br>'What happens if you study for a test?' (Cause: studying → Effect: doing well on the test).<br><br>Encourage participation: Allow students to come up with their own examples and share them with the class. Help guide them in identifying the cause and effect in each situation.",
      "<b>Part 4: Real-World Connections</b>:<br><br>Activity: Have students think about cause-and-effect relationships in larger systems, such as:<br>Environmental changes: 'What happens if we pollute the air?' (Cause: pollution → Effect: air quality worsens).<br>Social behavior: 'What happens if we treat others kindly?' (Cause: kindness → Effect: people are happy and trust each other).<br><br>Class discussion: Let students brainstorm other situations where a cause leads to an effect, explaining that understanding cause and effect helps us make better decisions.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Task: Provide students with a worksheet that has various scenarios, and have them identify the cause and effect in each.<br><br>Example worksheet questions could include:<br>'If it rains heavily, what happens?'<br>'If you don’t eat breakfast, what might happen?'<br>'If you forget your homework at home, what will be the result?'<br><br>Group work: Let students work in small groups to complete the worksheet.

      "<b>Part 4: Real-Life Application</b>:<br><br>Class discussion:<br>“How do people in very cold or very hot countries dress differently?”<br>“What should we wear for outdoor activities like hiking or swimming?”<br><br>Cause-and-effect examples:<br>• Wearing a thick sweater on a hot day → Feeling hot and sweaty.<br>• Wearing shorts in the snow → Feeling cold and uncomfortable.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise and Reflection</b>:<br><br>Task: Have students complete a worksheet:<br>1. Describe what they would wear for three different types of weather.<br>2. Explain why certain clothing is better for certain weather.<br>3. Think of a time they wore the wrong clothes for the weather—what happened?<br><br>Class discussion: Reinforce that choosing the right clothing helps us stay comfortable and safe in different weather conditions.<br><br>By the end of the lesson, students will understand how weather affects clothing choices and why dressing appropriately is important."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Light and Shadows</b>:<br><br>Discussion: Ask students:<br>“What happens when you shine a flashlight on an object in the dark?”<br>“Have you ever noticed how shadows change throughout the day?”<br><br>Explain cause and effect:<br>Cause: Light is blocked by objects.<br>Effect: A shadow is created behind the object.<br><br>Introduce key concepts:<br>Light travels in straight lines.<br>Shadows form when light is blocked by an object.<br>The position of the light source affects the size and direction of the shadow.",
      "<b>Part 2: Demonstrating Shadows</b>:<br><br>Activity: Use a flashlight to shine light on different objects (e.g., a book, a toy, a cup) in a dark room.<br>Step 1: Shine the flashlight straight at the object and observe the shadow.<br>Step 2: Move the flashlight closer or farther from the object and observe how the shadow changes.<br>Step 3: Change the angle of the flashlight and see how the shadow shifts.<br><br>Ask students:<br>“What happened when we moved the flashlight?”<br>“How did the shadow change when we changed the angle?”",
      "<b>Part 3: Student Experimentation</b>:<br><br>Task: Divide students into small groups and provide each group with a flashlight, different objects (e.g., toys, paper, blocks), and a dark area to experiment in.<br><br>Instructions:<br>Shine the flashlight on the objects from different angles and distances.<br>Observe and record how the shadows change.<br>Predict what will happen to the shadow if they change the position of the light source.<br><br>Discussion:<br>“Did your prediction match the result?”<br>“What happened to the shadow when the light source was close versus far?”<br>“How does the angle of the light affect the shadow?”",
      "<b>Part 4: Real-World Examples</b>:<br><br>Class discussion:<br>“Where do we see shadows in real life?” (e.g., shadows of trees, buildings, or people)<br>“How do shadows change throughout the day?” (e.g., longer in the morning and evening, shorter at noon)<br>“How do we use shadows to tell time (e.g., sundials)?<br><br>Explain:<br>As the sun moves, the position of the light changes, causing shadows to change in size and direction.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise and Reflection</b>:<br><br>Task: Have students complete a worksheet:<br>1. Draw a picture of an object with a shadow from different angles of light.<br>2. Explain how the position of the light source affects the shadow.<br>3. Predict what would happen to a shadow if the light source were moved higher or lower.<br><br>Class discussion: Share their predictions and reflect on how light affects the shadows we see around us."
