      "<b>Part 1: Introduction (10 minutes)</b><br><br><b>What is Reasoning?</b><br>Begin with a class discussion: 'Have you ever tried to figure out what happened when you didn't see it yourself?'<br>Explain that reasoning is how we think and make sense of things. There are different types of reasoning:<br>- Deductive reasoning (when we use facts to reach a certain conclusion).<br>- Inductive reasoning (when we see patterns and make general conclusions).<br>- Abductive reasoning (when we take the best guess based on clues).<br><br><b>What is Abductive Reasoning?</b><br>Abductive reasoning is making the best possible explanation based on the evidence available.<br>It’s like being a detective! You see clues and make a smart guess about what happened.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>Show a picture of a half-eaten apple on a table.<br>Ask: 'What do you think happened?'<br>Students may say:<br>- 'Someone took a bite and left it.'<br>- 'Maybe an animal or insect ate part of it.'<br>- 'Someone was eating but got distracted and forgot it.'",
      "<b>Part 2: Observing Clues (10 minutes)</b><br><br><b>Understanding How Clues Help Us Think</b><br>Show pictures of different scenarios and ask students to describe what they observe.<br><br><b>Example 1: A knocked-over chair and scattered books.</b><br>Ask: 'What do you see? What do you think happened?'<br>Possible answers:<br>- 'Maybe someone bumped into the chair and it fell.'<br>- 'Maybe a pet jumped on it and made it fall.'<br><br><b>Example 2: A puddle of water on the kitchen floor.</b><br>Ask: 'Where might the water have come from?'<br>Possible answers:<br>- 'Maybe someone spilled a drink.'<br>- 'Maybe the fridge was leaking.'<br><br><b>Discussion:</b><br>Explain that abductive reasoning helps us make the best possible guess, but we are not 100% sure unless we get more proof.",

If we could ask someone, check security cameras, or find other evidence, our reasoning could become stronger.",
      "<b>Part 4: Applying Abductive Reasoning (10 minutes)</b><br><br><b>Small Group Discussion</b><br>Divide students into small groups and give each group a different 'mystery' picture.<br><br><b>Example pictures:</b><br>- A broken pencil on a desk.<br>- A plate with crumbs but no food.<br>- A dog standing next to an open trash bin.<br><br>Each group discusses and comes up with the most logical explanation.<br>Groups share their reasoning with the class.",

Define it as a type of thinking where you observe something and then come up with the best possible explanation for it, even if you don’t have all the information. Abductive reasoning is often used in science to make educated guesses based on what we see or know.<br><br>Example: Explain that when a scientist sees a puddle on the ground, they might guess it rained recently because that’s the most likely explanation.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction (Engagement)</b>:<br><br>Begin by explaining to the students that they will be playing a detective game, where they need to use clues to solve a mystery.<br><br>Set the scene by describing a simple mystery, such as a missing marker or a misplaced object in the classroom. You can say, 'A marker has gone missing from the table! It's up to us to figure out who took it!'<br><br>Ask the students, 'What do detectives need to do when they are solving a mystery?' Encourage them to think about clues, evidence, and observations.",
      "<b>Part 2: Explanation (Modeling the Process)</b>:<br><br>Explain that detectives look at evidence (clues) and use reasoning to figure out what happened.<br><br>Walk the students through an example of how to analyze evidence. For instance, if a pencil is found on the floor, a detective would ask questions like, 'Who was near the desk when the pencil fell?' or 'Did anyone see anything?'<br><br>Show the students how to gather clues in a logical order and make inferences. For example, you could say, 'If a student was last seen near the table, they might know where the marker is.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice (Detective Activity)</b>:<br><br>Now, set up the mystery in the classroom. Hide the missing marker or another simple object and prepare clues (e.g., a note, a footprint, a piece of paper with handwriting).<br><br>Divide the class into small groups. Give each group a clue and allow them time to discuss what they think happened based on the clues.<br><br>Walk around to observe how each group is making connections and reasoning through the mystery. Encourage students to ask questions like, 'Who could have been near the desk?' or 'Does the clue tell us anything about where the marker might be?'",
      "<b>Part 4: Class Discussion (Critical Thinking)</b>:<br><br>After the students have gathered all the clues and made their conclusions, have a class discussion. Ask each group to present their theory on what happened and explain how they came to that conclusion using the evidence.<br><br>Encourage other students to ask questions and add new ideas to the discussion. For example, 'Do you think that person could have done it? Why or why not?' This will help strengthen their reasoning skills and develop their ability to make evidence-based explanations.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Task)</b>:<br><br>For the exercise, give the students a set of simple, imaginary clues about a new mystery (e.g., a lost pencil case, a broken chair). Each group will need to use the clues to figure out who might be responsible or what happened.<br><br>Ask the students to write down or verbally explain their reasoning based on the clues. They should include at least three pieces of evidence in their explanation.<br><br>Once all groups have shared their conclusions, review the answers together as a class and discuss the reasoning behind each conclusion."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Mystery and Abductive Reasoning</b>:<br><br>What is a Mystery?<br>A mystery is a story or situation where something strange happens, and it’s up to someone to figure out what happened using clues. It could be a missing object, a strange noise, or an unexplained event.<br><br>What is Abductive Reasoning?<br>Abductive reasoning is when you try to figure out the most likely explanation for something based on the clues you have. It’s like putting together pieces of a puzzle to solve a problem. For example, if you walk into a room and see muddy footprints, you might reason that someone with muddy shoes has been in the room.<br><br>Example Scenario: A toy is missing from the shelf.<br>Clues: There are paw prints leading to the window, and the window is slightly open.<br>Solution: You might deduce that a pet, like a dog, could have taken the toy and left through the window.",
      "<b>Part 2: Guided Practice - Creating a Mystery</b>:<br><br>In pairs, students will brainstorm and write down a mystery scenario. They should include:<br>- The event (What happened?)<br>- Clues that could help solve the mystery<br>- A character or characters involved (who might be the detective or the person solving the mystery?)<br><br>Example Prompt for Students:<br>Write a mystery where something is missing from the classroom. What are some clues that would help solve the mystery? Who is trying to figure out what happened?",
      "<b>Part 3: Solving a Mystery</b>:<br><br>After creating their mystery, students will swap their scenarios with another pair of classmates and use the clues to solve the mystery using abductive reasoning. Students will need to figure out the most likely explanation for what happened in the mystery.",
      "<b>Part 4: Class Discussion</b>:<br><br>Once students have swapped and attempted to solve the mysteries, they will come together as a class to discuss their findings. Each pair will share:<br>- The mystery they created<br>- The clues they provided<br>- How they solved the mystery (the reasoning behind it)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Creating and Solving Mysteries)</b>:<br><br>For this exercise, each student will:<br>- Write their own mystery: Students should create a short scenario, write it on a sheet of paper, and include clues that lead to the solution.<br>- Swap and solve: After finishing their mystery, students will swap with a partner and attempt to solve each other's mysteries. They will then share their answers with the class and explain the reasoning behind their solution."
