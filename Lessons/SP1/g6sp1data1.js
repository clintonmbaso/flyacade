      "<b>Part 4: Sharing and Discussing</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will share their endings with the class and discuss the creative choices they made.<br><br>Activity:<br>After the students finish their stories, invite some of them to share their endings with the class. Encourage them to explain why they chose those paths and how they imagined the characters would react.<br><br>Ask the class questions to spark discussion, such as:<br><br>'How did the character’s choices affect the outcome?'<br><br>'What might happen if the character made a different choice?'<br><br>'How did your ending change the mood or tone of the story?'",
      "<b>Part 5: Task and Conclusion</b>:<br><br>Task:<br>For homework or as a follow-up activity, ask students to write a short story with multiple endings. They should focus on creating a critical point in the story where the character has to make an important decision, and from that decision, two or more possible outcomes should arise.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Wrap up the lesson by emphasizing the importance of decision-making in storytelling. Explain that stories are powerful tools for exploring different possibilities and that sometimes, the direction a story takes is shaped by the choices characters make. Encourage students to think about how multiple endings can add depth and excitement to their own stories."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction</b>:<br><br>Introduce the lesson by explaining that basic shapes—like circles, squares, and triangles—are the building blocks for creating all kinds of objects. Show examples of everyday objects that are made from these shapes (e.g., a house can be made from squares and triangles, a car can be made from circles and rectangles). Explain that today, students will use their imagination to create different objects by combining basic shapes in new ways.",
      "<b>Part 2: Activity - Shape Cutouts</b>:<br><br>Provide students with cutouts of basic shapes (circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, etc.). You can also allow them to draw their own shapes if they prefer.<br><br>Ask them to use these shapes to create different objects. Some suggestions:<br>- A house (using squares for the base and a triangle for the roof)<br>- A car (using circles for wheels and rectangles for the body)<br>- A tree (using a triangle for the leaves and a rectangle for the trunk)<br>- A person (using circles for the head and body, rectangles for limbs)<br><br>Encourage students to think outside the box and explore how combining different shapes can create something new. They can create animals, buildings, or even imaginary creatures. Give them time to experiment and come up with their own creations.",
      "<b>Part 3: Explanation and Reflection</b>:<br><br>Ask students to share their creations with the class. For each object, they should explain:<br>- Which shapes they used<br>- How they combined them to make something new<br>- What other objects they could create using the same shapes (e.g., “I used a square and a triangle to make a house, but I could also make a boat or a tent with those same shapes.”)<br><br>Encourage students to think about how the same basic shapes can be reused and repurposed to create different things.",
      "<b>Part 4: Group Discussion</b>:<br><br>Lead a group discussion about the various objects created. Ask questions like:<br>- 'How did you combine shapes in unique ways?'<br>- 'What new ideas do you have for using shapes to create other objects?'<br>- 'What shapes do you think are the most useful for building things?'<br><br>Discuss how artists, architects, and engineers often use basic shapes in their designs.",
      "<b>Part 5: Task and Conclusion</b>:<br><br>As a follow-up task, ask students to choose one object they made in class and design a more detailed version using the same shapes. They can draw it, cut out more shapes, or even build a model if materials are available.<br><br>For homework, ask students to find examples of objects around their home or school that use basic shapes and write or draw a few of them.<br><br>Conclusion: Wrap up the lesson by reminding students that they can use simple shapes to create complex things. Encourage them to keep experimenting with shapes in their daily life and to see how many different objects they can create using basic building blocks."
