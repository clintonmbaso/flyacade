They should think about how much money they need to save for their goal and how long it will take if they save a little bit each week.<br><br>3. Have them draw a piggy bank or a savings jar, and inside it, write down their goal amount and how much they plan to save each week.<br><br>4. As an optional challenge, students can try to estimate how much money they would need to save if they save $1 per week, and how many weeks it would take to reach their goal."

Figure out how much money you can save each week or month ‚Äî maybe from your allowance or gifts.<br>4. Make a plan ‚Äî write down how long it will take to reach your goal.<br><br>Example:<br>If you want a toy that costs $20 and can save $5 each week, how many weeks will it take?

How many weeks will it take? __________<br><br>Help students complete the worksheet by guiding them step by step.<br><br>Discuss:<br>What will you do if you want something but realize it will take a long time to save for it?
