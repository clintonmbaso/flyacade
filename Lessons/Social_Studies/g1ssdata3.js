            "<b>Part 1: What is a Friend? (Introduction & Story Time)</b>:<br><br>(Teacher sits with students in a cozy circle.)<br><br>Hello, wonderful Feather Flyers! Today we are going to talk about something very special. It’s something that makes us feel happy and warm inside. We’re going to talk about friendship and love.<br><br>First, let's think about our friends. Who can tell me what a friend is? (Wait for a few answers. Students might say: 'Someone I play with,' 'My cousin,' etc.)<br><br>Those are all great answers! A friend is someone we like to spend time with. They are someone who makes us smile and who we enjoy sharing our toys and stories with.<br><br>Now, let’s read a story about some friends who need to figure things out. (Read the book 'How Do Dinosaurs Stay Friends?' or your chosen story. Pause to ask questions like, 'Was that a kind thing to do?' or 'How do you think he feels?')",
            "<b>Part 2: The Qualities of a Super Friend (Building Our List)</b>:<br><br>(After the story, gather in front of the chart paper or whiteboard.)<br><br>That story showed us that sometimes friends make mistakes, but what's important is how we fix them! Let’s make a list of all the things that make someone a Super Friend.<br><br>I’ll draw a big sunshine, and we’ll write the qualities on the rays! (Draw a sun. As students suggest ideas, guide them and write each one on a sunray.)<br><br>· Kindness: How are we kind? (We use nice words, we share).<br>· Sharing: We share our toys, our snacks, and our time.<br>· Helping: A good friend helps you if you fall down or can’t reach something.<br>· Listening: We listen with our ears and our eyes when our friend is talking.<br>· Taking Turns: Friends let others go first sometimes.<br>· Saying Sorry: If we hurt our friend's feelings, we say 'I'm sorry.'<br>· Forgiving: When a friend says sorry, we say 'That's okay.'<br><br>Wow! Look at all these amazing superpowers a good friend has!",
            "<b>Part 3: Friendship and Love in Action (The Heart Activity)</b>:<br><br>(Hold up the large paper heart.)<br><br>This heart represents our feelings. When we are with our friends, our hearts feel full and happy. But sometimes, our feelings can get hurt. If someone says something unkind or doesn't share, it can put a little wrinkle in our heart. (Crumple a small section of the heart.)<br><br>See? It doesn't feel so smooth anymore. How can we smooth it out and make it better? (Students will likely say 'Say sorry!' or 'Be nice!')<br><br>That’s right! When we say sorry and try to be kind, we help fix the hurt feelings. (Smooth out the heart and place the bandage sticker on the crumpled spot.)<br><br>We can't always make the wrinkle completely disappear, just like we might remember that our feelings were hurt. But with kindness and love, we can help it feel much better. Love is the super-strong feeling of caring for someone and wanting them to be happy. We can show love to our friends by using all those Super Friend qualities on our list!",
            "<b>Part 4: Let's Practice! How Would You Help? (Discussion)</b>:<br><br>Now let’s practice being Super Friends. I’ll tell you about a problem, and you tell me what a good friend would do.<br><br>1. Scenario 1: You see your friend sitting alone on the bench at recess. They look sad. What can you do? (Possible Answer: Go ask them to play with me.)<br>2. Scenario 2: Your friend is building a tall tower with blocks. You really want a block they are using. What do you do? (Possible Answer: Wait for my turn or ask nicely if I can use it next.)<br>3. Scenario 3: You accidentally bump into your friend and they drop their crayons. What do you do? (Possible Answer: Say 'I'm sorry!' and help them pick up the crayons.)<br><br>You all have such great ideas! You are becoming friendship experts!",
            "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Draw Your Super Friend!</b>:<br><br>(Time for students to work at their desks or tables.)<br><br>Now it’s your turn to create! I want you to think about what you’ve learned today.<br><br>Your task is to:<br><br>1. Draw a picture of you and a friend being Super Friends.<br>2. Show one of the Super Friend qualities from our list in your drawing. Are you sharing a toy? Helping them up? Playing together nicely?<br>3. When you are done, we will share our drawings with the class and guess which Super Friend quality they are showing!<br><br>(Hand out drawing paper and crayons. Give students time to draw. As they finish, have a few volunteers show their picture and explain it, or let the class guess the friendship quality.)<br><br>Wrap-up: 'Fantastic job, Feather Flyers! Look at all these wonderful pictures of friendship and kindness. Let's try to use our Super Friend powers every day to make our classroom and our world a happier place. Thank you for being such great friends!'"

            "<b>Part 1: Welcome and Introduction (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher Says: 'Good morning, Feather Flyers! Today we are going to talk about a very special friend. He is a friend to everyone, but he especially loves children. His name is Jesus. Has anyone heard the name Jesus before?'<br><br>(Let a few students share if they wish.)<br><br>Teacher Says: 'That's great! Jesus lived a long, long time ago, and people wrote stories about his kindness in a very special book called the Bible.

(You can use any simple song, or sing: 'Hello, hello, it's time to learn, about our friend Jesus, and the love he showed!')",
            "<b>Part 2: Bible Story Time – Jesus Welcomes Children (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher Says: 'One day, Jesus was talking to some grown-ups. Some moms and dads started to bring their children to see Jesus because they knew he was kind and good. But Jesus's friends thought he was too busy and important for little children. They said, 'No, no, Jesus is too busy. Go away, children.''<br><br>(Show a picture of the disciples turning the children away. Look a little sad.)<br><br>Teacher Says: 'But when Jesus saw what was happening, he said, 'STOP! Let the children come to me! Do not send them away.''<br><br>(Show a picture of Jesus smiling with children on his lap and all around him. Smile brightly!)<br><br>Teacher Says: 'Jesus was not too busy. He hugged the children, he blessed them, and he said that everyone should have a heart that is loving and trusting like a child's heart. He wanted them to come to him! This shows us that Jesus always has time for children. He loves you very, very much.'<br><br>Discussion Question: 'How would you feel if a special friend like Jesus gave you a big hug?' (Happy, loved, safe, special).",
            "<b>Part 3: Jesus Cares for Children – A Story of Healing (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher Says: 'Jesus didn't just give hugs; he also helped children when they were sick. There was a little girl who was very, very sick. Her family was so sad. They found Jesus and asked him for help.'<br><br>'Jesus went to their house. He saw the little girl. He held her hand and said, 'Little girl, get up!' And guess what? She opened her eyes, got up, and was all better! Her family was so happy and thankful for Jesus.'<br><br>(Show a picture of this story.)<br><br>Teacher Says: 'This story shows us that Jesus cares about us. He wants us to be healthy and happy. He is a friend who helps us and makes things better.'<br><br>Discussion Question: 'Who helps you when you feel sick or sad?' (Mom, dad, grandma, doctor, teacher). 'Jesus is like that too—a helper and a healer.'",
            "<b>Part 4: What is a Childlike Heart? (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher Says: 'Remember when Jesus said we should have hearts like children? He didn't mean we should act like babies. He meant we should have hearts that are:'<br><br>· Kind: We share our toys and use nice words.<br>· Trusting: We believe our parents and teachers will take care of us.<br>· Loving: We give hugs and are good friends.<br>· Ready to say sorry: When we make a mistake, we try to fix it.<br><br>Teacher Says: 'Having a heart like this makes Jesus happy and makes us good friends to everyone around us.'",
            "<b>Part 5: Exercise & Activity Time! (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Let's choose one or two activities to do!<br><br>Activity 1: Draw Your Favorite Story<br><br>· Give each student a piece of paper and crayons.<br>· Instructions: 'Draw a picture of Jesus being a kind friend. Maybe he is hugging the children, or helping the little girl get better, or just sitting and listening to them. Show how happy and loved the children feel.'<br>· As they draw, walk around and ask them to tell you about their picture.<br><br>Activity 2: Complete the Sentence<br><br>· On the whiteboard, write: 'Jesus is a good friend because he is _______________.'<br>· Have students help you think of words to finish the sentence (e.g., kind, loving, strong, a helper, a listener).<br>· Write their ideas on the board. They can then copy one word onto their drawing.<br><br>Activity 3: Sing a Song<br><br>· Learn and sing a simple song together.<br>  · (To the tune of 'Frère Jacques')<br>  · Jesus loves us, Jesus loves us,<br>  · Yes, he does! Yes, he does!<br>  · He is our special friend,<br>  · His love will never end,<br>  · Yes, it's true! Yes, it's true!<br><br>Wrap-Up (5 minutes)<br><br>'Wonderful job today, Feather Flyers! We learned that Jesus is a special friend who always has time for children, who helps us, and who loves us very much. Let's all try to have kind and loving hearts this week, just like Jesus loves.'<br><br>'Give yourself a big hug and say, 'I am loved.' Now give a friend a high-five and say, 'You are loved too!''"

      "<b>Part 1: Jesus Heals a Sick Child</b>:<br><br>Story: Jesus Heals Jairus' Daughter<br>There was once a man named Jairus whose daughter was very sick. He was very worried and asked Jesus for help. Jesus agreed to go with Jairus to his house. While they were on their way, people came and said the girl had already died. But Jesus told Jairus not to be afraid and to have faith. When they arrived at the house, Jesus went to the girl’s room, took her hand, and said, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” The girl stood up, and everyone was amazed (Mark 5:21-43).<br><br>Explanation:<br>Jesus showed friendship by helping and healing Jairus’ daughter, even when others thought it was too late.

      "<b>Part 2: Jesus Teaches About Childlike Faith</b>:<br><br>Story: Jesus and the Importance of Childlike Faith<br>One day, Jesus' disciples were arguing about who was the greatest among them. Jesus called a little child to Him and said:<br>“Unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 18:1-4).<br><br>Explanation:<br>Jesus used the example of a child to teach an important lesson: that we should all be humble and trusting like children.<br>Jesus loved children for their pure hearts and wanted everyone to have faith like a child.<br>This story shows that Jesus valued the qualities of children and wanted others to learn from their example.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Ask students: Why do you think Jesus said we should be like children?<br>Discuss how being humble, trusting, and kind makes us better people and better friends to others.",

If someone is sick, we can comfort them, pray for them, or help them feel better.<br><br>2. Being Humble and Kind<br>Jesus taught that being humble and kind is important.
