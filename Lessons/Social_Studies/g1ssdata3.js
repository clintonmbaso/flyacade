      "<b>What is Currency?</b><br>Currency refers to the money used in a country for buying and selling. Every country has its own money, and in Zambia, we use the Kwacha. There are two types of currency in Zambia: coins and banknotes. Coins are often used for smaller transactions, like buying snacks or paying for transport, while banknotes are used for larger purchases.",
      "<b>Zambian Coin Denominations:</b><br>Denominations are the different values that coins and banknotes have. In Zambia, coins come in different denominations, such as 5 Ngwee, 10 Ngwee, 50 Ngwee, and 1 Kwacha. Each coin represents a specific value, and we use these for smaller payments. The 5 Ngwee coin is the smallest, while the 1 Kwacha coin is worth the most among coins.",
      "<b>Importance of Coins for Small Transactions:</b><br>Coins are very useful for small purchases. For example, you can use coins to buy a snack or pay for your bus fare. Coins are small, lightweight, and perfect for quick payments. Because they are easy to carry, they are used every day for smaller transactions.",
      "<b>Unique Symbols and Designs on Zambian Coins:</b><br>Each Zambian coin has special symbols or animals on it. These designs are important because they represent Zambia’s culture, history, and wildlife. By looking at the designs, you can quickly recognize the value of a coin. For example, the 5 Ngwee coin shows a bird, and the 1 Kwacha coin has a fish. This helps us easily identify the coins.",
