Sweeping can be done both inside the house (on the floors) and outside (on pathways or patios).<br><br>Why It’s Important: Sweeping keeps the home clean, prevents dust from building up, and makes the environment more pleasant.<br><br>How to Do It: Hold a broom firmly and move it from one side to the other, pushing the dirt into a pile.<br><br>2. Slashing<br>Slashing involves cutting tall grass or weeds, usually in the yard or garden. It helps keep the outdoor areas clean and free from overgrown plants. Slashing is done with a tool called a slasher.<br><br>Why It’s Important: Slashing helps to keep the garden neat and prevents weeds from taking over the yard. It also helps avoid pests or snakes hiding in tall grass.<br><br>How to Do It: Carefully use a slasher to cut down tall grass, moving it slowly to avoid accidents.<br><br>3. Raking<br>Raking is the process of using a rake to gather fallen leaves, grass, or debris. It helps to collect everything into a pile so it can be thrown away or used in compost.<br><br>Why It’s Important: Raking keeps the yard tidy, especially during times when leaves fall, like in autumn. It also helps to prepare the garden for new planting.<br><br>How to Do It: Use a rake to gather leaves or grass into a pile, making it easier to clean up.",
      "<b>Part 3: Responsibilities and Teamwork in the Home</b>:<br><br>Sharing Household Roles:<br>Each family member has a responsibility in the home, whether it’s a small task or a big one. When everyone works together, the house stays clean, and there’s more time for fun.<br><br>Assigning Roles:<br>Parents or caregivers often assign roles based on age and ability. For example, younger children may help with small tasks like sweeping, while older family members may take on tasks like slashing or raking.<br><br>Everyone’s help matters, no matter how small the task is!<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What roles do you play at home? Do you help with sweeping or cleaning your room?",
      "<b>Part 4: The Importance of Keeping the Home Clean</b>:<br><br>Why Cleaning the Home Matters:<br>A clean home is a healthy and happy home. When we keep our homes clean, we are taking care of our families. Clean homes also help prevent sickness by getting rid of dust, dirt, and germs.<br><br>Working Together:<br>Cleaning the home is not just the responsibility of parents or caregivers. When children help out, they learn responsibility and contribute to the well-being of the family.<br><br>Reflection:<br>Ask students to think about the roles they enjoy most at home and why they are important.<br><br>How do you feel when you help around the house?<br><br>Why do you think it’s important to work together with your family?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>1. What is sweeping, and why is it important?<br>2. What tool do we use for sweeping?<br>3. What is slashing, and where is it done?<br>4. Why is slashing necessary in the yard?<br>5. What is raking, and what does it help clean up?<br>6. What tool do we use for raking?<br>7.
