      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to First Aid for Common Injuries</b>:<br><br>Start by explaining the importance of knowing how to treat common injuries such as cuts, scrapes, and burns, as these are common accidents that happen daily.<br><br>Discuss the purpose of using sterile bandages and burn dressings:<br><br>Sterile Bandages: Used to cover cuts, scrapes, and wounds to stop bleeding, prevent infection, and promote healing.<br>Burn Dressings: Used to soothe and protect burns from infection, reduce pain, and promote healing.<br><br>Key Points to Cover:<br>- Always clean the wound first before applying a bandage or burn dressing.<br>- Never apply a bandage too tightly, as it could cut off circulation.<br>- Use the correct type of dressing for the injury: a sterile bandage for cuts and scrapes, and a burn dressing for burns.",
      "<b>Part 2: Demonstrating the Proper Use of Sterile Bandages for Cuts and Scrapes</b>:<br><br>Step-by-Step Instructions for Applying Sterile Bandages:<br>1. Clean the Wound:<br>- Wash your hands thoroughly.<br>- Clean the wound using clean water or antiseptic wipes to remove dirt and bacteria.<br>2. Apply Antiseptic:<br>- If available, apply an antiseptic cream or solution to the wound to help prevent infection.<br>3. Prepare the Bandage:<br>- Open the sterile bandage pack carefully without touching the sterile part of the bandage.<br>4. Apply the Bandage:<br>- Gently place the bandage over the wound.<br>- Make sure the adhesive part sticks well but does not touch the wound directly.<br>- If needed, use additional gauze to absorb any blood.<br>5. Secure the Bandage:<br>- Wrap the bandage snugly, but not too tightly, to ensure it stays in place without restricting circulation.<br>6. Dispose of Used Items Properly:<br>- Safely dispose of the used antiseptic wipes, gloves (if any), and packaging.<br><br>Practical Activity:<br>Demonstrate on a model or volunteer how to apply the bandage to a small cut or scrape. Allow students to practice applying bandages on each other or practice wounds to ensure they understand the technique.",
      "<b>Part 3: Demonstrating the Proper Use of Burn Dressing for Minor Burns</b>:<br><br>Step-by-Step Instructions for Applying Burn Dressing:<br>1. Cool the Burn:<br>- For a minor burn, immediately cool the area by running it under cold water for at least 10 minutes, or until the pain starts to lessen.<br>- Important: Never use ice directly on burns, as it can cause further damage.<br>2. Prepare the Burn Dressing:<br>- Open the burn dressing or sterile burn sheet without touching the dressingâ€™s surface that will touch the burn area.<br>3. Apply the Dressing:<br>- Gently place the burn dressing on the burn area. Do not press hard on the burn.<br>- If using a burn gel, apply it to the burn area before placing the dressing on top.<br>4. Secure the Dressing:<br>- Use an elastic bandage or tape to secure the dressing in place, but make sure it's not too tight.<br>5. Monitor the Injury:<br>- Keep an eye on the burn for any signs of infection or increased pain. If necessary, seek medical help.<br><br>Practical Activity:<br>Demonstrate applying a burn dressing to a simulated minor burn on a volunteer or model. Allow students to practice focusing on proper technique and comfort.",
      "<b>Part 4: Safety Precautions and When to Seek Professional Help</b>:<br><br>Explain the importance of safety when performing first aid:<br>- Always wear gloves (if available) when treating open wounds.<br>- Never use burn dressings on severe burns or burns with blistersâ€”seek medical attention immediately.<br><br>Discuss situations where professional medical help is needed:<br>- For cuts: If the cut is large, deep, or doesn't stop bleeding after applying pressure.<br>- For burns: If the burn is severe, covers a large area, or involves blisters, it's important to seek medical care right away.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: First Aid Role Play</b>:<br><br>After learning how to apply sterile bandages and burn dressings, students will work in pairs to perform a role-play exercise where one student acts as the injured person and the other as the first aid provider.<br><br>Instructions for the Exercise:<br>1. Scenario 1 â€“ Cut or Scrape:<br>- One student pretends to have a cut or scrape on their arm.<br>- The other student practices cleaning the wound, applying antiseptic, and properly covering it with a sterile bandage.<br>2. Scenario 2 â€“ Minor Burn:<br>- One student pretends to have a minor burn on their hand or arm.<br>- The other student practices cooling the burn, applying burn gel (if available), and covering it with a burn dressing.<br><br>Reflection:<br>After the role-play, gather the students and ask them what they learned. Have each group share one thing they did correctly and one thing they could improve upon."
