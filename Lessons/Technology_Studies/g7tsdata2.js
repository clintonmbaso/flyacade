      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Magnets and Magnetic Materials</b>:<br><br>A magnet is an object that produces a magnetic field. Materials that are attracted to magnets are called magnetic materials. The most common magnetic materials are iron, nickel, and cobalt. These materials can be attracted by a magnet due to their magnetic properties.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>Magnets have two poles: North and South.<br>Magnetic fields are invisible forces that attract or repel objects.<br>Only certain materials, like iron, nickel, and cobalt, are attracted to magnets.<br><br>Discussion Prompt:<br>'Can anyone think of an everyday item that might be magnetic?'",
      "<b>Part 2: Magnetic vs. Non-Magnetic Materials</b>:<br><br>Magnetic materials: These materials are attracted to magnets (e.g., iron, steel, cobalt, nickel).<br>Non-magnetic materials: Materials that are not attracted to magnets (e.g., wood, plastic, glass, and most metals like copper and aluminum).<br><br><b>Demonstration:</b><br>Use a magnet and a few objects (iron nail, plastic spoon, copper coin, and a piece of wood). Show which materials the magnet attracts and which it does not.<br><br>Discussion Prompt:<br>'What do you think happens when we bring a magnet close to a material? What materials are attracted to magnets in this demonstration?'",
      "<b>Part 3: Magnetism in Nature and Everyday Life</b>:<br><br>Magnets are used in various devices such as compasses, speakers, and electric motors. Natural magnets, also known as lodestones, are found in nature.<br><br><b>Examples of Uses:</b><br>Compass: The needle of a compass is a magnet that aligns with Earth's magnetic field.<br>Speakers and Microphones: These devices use magnets to produce sound.<br><br>Discussion Prompt:<br>'How do you think a compass works? Can you think of other devices around us that use magnets?'",
      "<b>Part 4: Magnetic Fields and How They Work</b>:<br><br>A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where magnetic forces are felt. It is invisible, but it can be demonstrated using iron filings, which will form patterns around the poles of a magnet.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>The magnetic field is strongest at the poles of a magnet.<br>The field causes materials like iron to align and become magnetic when close to a magnet.<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Place a magnet under a piece of paper and sprinkle iron filings on top to observe the magnetic field pattern.<br><br>Discussion Prompt:<br>'What do you notice about how the iron filings form around the magnet?'",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Identifying Magnetic Materials</b>:<br><br>Provide students with a variety of objects (e.g., key, coin, paperclip, rubber band, wooden stick, plastic spoon, aluminum foil).<br>Ask students to predict which materials will be attracted to a magnet.<br>Have students test each item with a magnet to see if it is attracted.<br>As a class, discuss the results and categorize the materials into magnetic and non-magnetic.<br><br><b>Extension Activity:</b><br>Students can create a chart of magnetic and non-magnetic materials, including pictures of items they tested in class.<br><br>Wrap-Up Discussion:<br>'What did you learn from today's activity? Were there any surprises in the materials that were attracted to the magnets?'"

    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Costing and Pricing</b>:<br><br>Definition of Costing: Explain that costing is the process of determining how much it costs to produce a product or provide a service. This includes all the materials, labor, and overhead costs involved.<br><br>Definition of Pricing: Pricing is the amount of money a customer will pay for a product or service. It involves adding a profit margin to the cost of the product or service.<br><br>Importance of Costing and Pricing: Discuss why it’s important for businesses to know the cost of their products and services and set appropriate prices to make a profit while being competitive in the market.",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding the Costing Process</b>:<br><br><b>Step 1: Calculate the Direct Costs:</b><br>Materials: How much do the raw materials cost to make the product?<br>Labor: How much does the labor cost to create the product or provide the service?<br>Example: If it costs $5 to buy materials for a bracelet and $3 for labor, the total direct cost is $8.<br><br><b>Step 2: Calculate the Indirect Costs:</b><br>Include things like rent, utilities, and transportation. For example, if the business spends $100 a month on rent and makes 100 products, then the indirect cost per product is $1.<br><br><b>Step 3: Total Cost:</b><br>Total cost is the sum of direct costs and indirect costs. For example, if a product costs $8 in direct costs and $1 in indirect costs, the total cost is $9.",
      "<b>Part 3: Setting the Price</b>:<br><br><b>Step 1: Understand Market Research:</b><br>Discuss the importance of understanding what similar products or services are being sold for in the market. This helps set a competitive price.<br><br><b>Step 2: Add a Profit Margin:</b><br>Once you know the total cost, you add a profit margin. A typical margin might be 20%, but it can vary based on the type of product or service and the business model. Example: If the total cost is $9, and you want to add a 20% profit margin, you calculate the selling price as follows: Selling Price = Cost + (Cost * Profit Margin)<br>Selling Price = $9 + ($9 * 0.20) = $10.80.<br><br><b>Step 3: Consider Taxes:</b><br>Don’t forget to consider sales tax, which can be added to the final price depending on local regulations.",
      "<b>Part 4: Factors Affecting Costing and Pricing</b>:<br><br><b>Market Demand:</b> If many people want a particular product, businesses can sometimes charge higher prices.<br><b>Competitor Pricing:</b> If competitors are charging lower prices, you may need to adjust your pricing strategy to stay competitive.<br><b>Seasonality:</b> Some crafts or services may have higher demand during specific seasons (e.g., holiday-themed crafts), allowing for higher prices during peak times.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b> To practice calculating the cost and price of a craft.<br><b>Instructions:</b><br>1. Break the class into small groups.<br>2. Give each group a hypothetical craft or service (e.g., a handmade bracelet, a cake decoration service, a gardening service).<br>3. Each group will:<br>- Identify the materials and labor required.<br>- Calculate the direct and indirect costs.<br>- Set a price for their craft/service, including a 20% profit margin.<br>4. After 15 minutes, each group will present their pricing strategy, including the total cost and the final price they set.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>Craft: Handmade Greeting Cards<br>Materials Cost: $1 per card (paper, ink, etc.)<br>Labor Cost: $2 per card (time spent creating the card)<br>Indirect Costs: $0.50 per card (electricity, workspace)<br>Total Cost: $3.50<br>Profit Margin: 20% → Selling Price = $3.50 + ($3.50 * 0.20) = $4.20<br><br>Discussion:<br>After the presentations, discuss how different groups approached pricing, what factors they considered, and any challenges they encountered in setting the right price."

      "<b>Part 1: Clearing the Land</b>:<br><br>The first step in preparing land for construction is clearing the area. This involves removing any obstacles, such as trees, bushes, rocks, and debris, from the construction site. The land must be cleared to create a flat, safe, and open space for building. This step is crucial because it ensures that there is nothing that might interfere with the foundation or structure of the building. Heavy machinery such as bulldozers and excavators is often used for this task.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>Remove trees, bushes, and other obstacles.<br>Make the land open and safe for the next steps.<br>Ensure no objects interfere with the foundation.",
      "<b>Part 2: Setting the Site</b>:<br><br>Once the land is cleared, the next step is setting the site. This involves marking out where the building will be located. Surveyors use tools like measuring tapes and lasers to measure and mark the exact boundaries of the construction area. It's important to ensure that everything is measured accurately so that the building will be in the right place. This step also involves ensuring the land is level and stable, which is necessary for the foundation to support the structure.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>Mark the location of the building on the land.<br>Ensure measurements are accurate.<br>Check that the ground is level and stable.",
      "<b>Part 3: Digging the Foundation</b>:<br><br>The third stage is digging. After the site is set, the next step is to dig the foundation trenches. The foundation is what supports the weight of the building, so it’s very important that the trenches are dug to the correct depth and width. Workers dig these trenches using tools like shovels, picks, or machinery, depending on the size of the project. Sometimes, concrete is poured into the trenches to create a strong foundation that will prevent the building from sinking or shifting.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>Dig trenches for the foundation.<br>Ensure trenches are the correct size and depth.<br>Pour concrete into the trenches for stability.",
      "<b>Part 4: Construction</b>:<br><br>The final stage is construction, where the actual building of the structure begins. Once the foundation is in place, builders can start constructing the walls, floors, and roof of the building. This process involves many steps, such as erecting frames, installing plumbing and electrical systems, and adding finishing touches like windows and doors. Construction workers, architects, and engineers all work together to make sure the building is stable, safe, and functional.<br><br><b>Key Points:</b><br>Begin building the structure after the foundation is ready.<br>Construct walls, floors, and roofs.<br>Install plumbing, electrical systems, and finishing elements.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Understanding the Stages</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br><br>1. Match the stages with their descriptions:<br><br>Clearing: a) Dig trenches for the foundation.<br>b) Remove obstacles like trees and rocks from the land.<br><br>Setting the site: a) Mark out where the building will be placed.<br>b) Build the structure from the foundation up.<br><br>Digging the foundation: a) Ensure the land is level.<br>b) Dig trenches for the foundation.<br><br>Construction: a) Install windows and doors.<br>b) Build the actual structure of the building.<br><br>2.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Design Process</b>:<br><br>The design process is a series of steps used to solve a problem or create a new product. Designers, engineers, and inventors use it to come up with solutions that meet people's needs. The process helps break down complex problems into manageable stages. The first three stages of the design process are:<br>1. Problem Identification<br>2. Ideation<br>3. Concept Development",
      "<b>Part 2: Stage 1 – Problem Identification</b>:<br><br>Problem Identification is the first step in the design process. It involves recognizing and understanding the problem that needs to be solved. This step is crucial because without clearly identifying the problem, it is difficult to find the right solution.<br><br>Key Questions:<br>What is the problem we are trying to solve?<br>Who is affected by this problem?<br>Why does this problem need a solution?<br><br>Example: Imagine you are designing a chair for someone who has trouble sitting for long periods. The problem is that regular chairs are uncomfortable for people who have back pain.",
      "<b>Part 3: Stage 2 – Ideation</b>:<br><br>Ideation is the brainstorming stage. After identifying the problem, designers begin thinking of possible solutions. In this stage, creativity and open thinking are encouraged. There are no 'bad ideas' at this point, and the goal is to come up with a wide range of ideas.<br><br>Key Activities:<br>Brainstorming<br>Sketching and drawing<br>Discussing different approaches<br>Considering all possibilities, even unconventional ones.<br><br>Example: For the chair problem, you might brainstorm ideas such as a chair with extra lumbar support, a chair with adjustable parts, or a chair that reclines. The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible.",
      "<b>Part 4: Stage 3 – Concept Development</b>:<br><br>Concept Development is the stage where you begin narrowing down your ideas from the ideation phase. You start to select the most promising ideas and develop them further. This includes refining the design, considering practical aspects, and creating models or prototypes.<br><br>Key Questions:<br>Which idea best addresses the problem?<br>How can this idea be improved?<br>What materials and resources are needed?<br><br>Example: You may decide that the chair with adjustable parts is the best solution. Now, you start designing how it will look and work, considering materials, colors, and size, and even making a small model to test the design.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Apply the Design Process</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>1. Problem Identification:<br>Think of a problem you face daily (e.g., organizing your school desk, carrying heavy books, or finding a way to store your sports equipment).<br>Write a short description of the problem, explaining who it affects and why it needs a solution.<br><br>2. Ideation:<br>Brainstorm at least 5 possible solutions for your problem. Write or draw your ideas.<br>Do not worry about the feasibility just yet; let your creativity flow!<br><br>3. Concept Development:<br>Pick your favorite idea from the brainstormed list and start developing it further. Consider how you can make it more practical.<br>Draw a rough sketch of your idea, including its features and details that could solve the problem.<br><br>Reflection:<br>After completing the exercise, discuss with a partner or in small groups how your ideas changed from the start to the final concept. Which solution seems most practical, and why?"

      "<b>Part 1: Review of the First Three Stages</b>:<br><br>To refresh our memory, let's briefly review the first three stages of the design process:<br><br>1. Problem Identification – Understanding the problem and who is affected by it.<br>2. Ideation – Brainstorming and creating multiple ideas to solve the problem.<br>3. Concept Development – Narrowing down ideas and refining them into workable solutions.<br><br>Now, let's dive into the last three stages.",
      "<b>Part 2: Stage 4 – Prototyping</b>:<br><br>Prototyping is the stage where you create a working model of your design. A prototype helps you see how your idea will function in real life. It’s a way to turn your conceptual idea into something physical that you can test and improve.<br><br><b>Key Steps:</b><br>- Build a simple model or version of your design.<br>- Focus on creating the core features, not necessarily all the details.<br>- Use basic materials like paper, cardboard, or modeling clay to create a quick prototype.<br><br><b>Example:</b> For the chair design, you could make a prototype using cardboard to represent the frame and cushions. This prototype doesn't have to be perfect but should demonstrate the chair's basic structure.",
      "<b>Part 3: Stage 5 – Testing</b>:<br><br>Testing is the stage where you evaluate your prototype to see if it works as intended. You check for any flaws and gather feedback on how it can be improved. The goal of testing is to find out whether the design solves the problem effectively.<br><br><b>Key Steps:</b><br>- Test your prototype in real-life situations.<br>- Observe how it works and ask for feedback from others.<br>- Take note of any issues or problems that arise.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Test your chair prototype by sitting on it for a while. Does it support your back comfortably? Is it adjustable? Ask someone else to try it out and see if they experience the same comfort.",
      "<b>Part 4: Stage 6 – Evaluation</b>:<br><br>Evaluation is the final stage of the design process. After testing your prototype, you reflect on the results and determine if the design meets the problem-solving goals. You consider improvements and modifications, and you decide whether the design is ready for production or needs further changes.<br><br><b>Key Questions:</b><br>- Did the prototype solve the problem?<br>- What worked well, and what didn’t?<br>- What improvements can be made before the final version?<br>- Is the design ready to be shared or put into use?<br><br><b>Example:</b> After testing the chair prototype, you may find that the seat is too small or the backrest is not supportive enough. You would need to evaluate these issues and consider how to improve the design before creating a final version.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Apply the Final Stages of the Design Process</b>:<br><br><b>Instructions:</b><br><br>1. <b>Prototyping:</b> Take your idea from the last lesson (e.g., a new type of desk organizer) and create a simple prototype. Use materials you have available (paper, cardboard, or other supplies). Focus on the main feature of your design that solves the problem.<br><br>2. <b>Testing:</b> Test your prototype by using it in the way it was intended (e.g., if it's a desk organizer, place some items on it and see how well it holds them). Ask a friend or family member to try it out and provide feedback.<br><br>3. <b>Evaluation:</b> After testing, write down what worked well with your prototype and what needs improvement. Think about how you could modify the design to make it more effective or practical.<br><br><b>Reflection:</b> Discuss with your classmates how the testing and evaluation stages helped you improve your design. Were there any surprising results during testing? What changes would you make in the next version?"

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Design Process Stages</b>:<br><br>Before we begin, let's quickly review the stages of the design process that we’ll use for our practical project:<br><br>1. Problem Identification – Identify and understand the problem.<br>2. Ideation – Brainstorm possible solutions to the problem.<br>3. Concept Development – Develop and refine the most promising idea.<br>4. Prototyping – Create a working model or prototype of your idea.<br>5. Testing – Test the prototype to see if it works as planned.<br>6. Evaluation – Reflect on the results and decide on improvements.",
      "<b>Part 2: Choosing a Problem to Solve</b>:<br><br>For this project, we will apply the design process to solve a problem. Let's first identify a problem that we can work on. Here are a few options to choose from:<br><br>1. Creating a more efficient way to organize school supplies.<br>2. Designing a better pencil case that holds everything you need.<br>3. Creating a sustainable way to reduce waste in the classroom (e.g., reusable lunch containers).<br><br>Activity: As a class, vote on which problem you would like to solve. Once we have selected the problem, we will move through the design process steps together.",
      "<b>Part 3: Step-by-Step Application of the Design Process</b>:<br><br>Step 1: Problem Identification<br><br>Objective: Clearly define the problem you are solving.<br>Task: Work in pairs or small groups to discuss the problem. Write down:<br>1. What is the problem?<br>2. Who is affected by it?<br>3. Why does it need a solution?<br><br>Example: If the problem is organizing school supplies, the problem might be that students often lose or can't find their supplies in their bags, making it hard to stay organized and on time.",
      "<b>Step 2: Ideation</b>:<br><br>Objective: Brainstorm ideas that could solve the problem.<br>Task: In your groups, come up with at least 5 different solutions. Think creatively, and don’t worry about whether the ideas are perfect. Write or sketch your ideas.<br><br>Example: A pencil case with separate compartments for different items. A backpack with built-in organizers for each type of school supply. A foldable storage box that students can use to organize their desk.",
