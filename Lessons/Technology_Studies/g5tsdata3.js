    [
      "<b>Understanding the Save Command:</b><br>The Save command is used to store changes made to a file. When you click Save, the file is updated with the latest changes and remains in the same location with the same name. Use Save when you want to update your file without changing its name or location. For example, clicking Save on a document will update it while keeping the same file name and folder location. To save quickly, click File > Save or press Ctrl + S (Cmd + S on Mac).",
      "<b>Understanding the Save As Command:</b><br>The Save As command creates a new copy of the file with a different name or location. This is useful when you need to keep the original file unchanged while creating a new version. For example, if you want to save a new version of a report for a presentation, use Save As to rename the new file. Access Save As by clicking File > Save As and selecting a new name or location.",
      "<b>Choosing a File Name and Location:</b><br>When using Save As, choose a clear and descriptive file name to make it easy to identify later. Avoid vague names like 'Document1.' Select a location where you can easily find the file, such as Documents, Desktop, or Downloads. Organize files into folders for better management. For example, save a budget report as '2024 Budget Report' in a folder named 'Financial Reports.' Avoid special characters in file names and keep them descriptive but concise.",
      "<b>Managing File Versions:</b><br>Managing file versions helps track changes and avoid confusion between drafts or updates. Use Save As to create new versions and include version numbers or dates in the file name, such as 'Report_V1,' 'Report_V2,' or 'Report_2024-09-16.' Regularly save new versions to document progress and allow for reviewing or reverting to earlier versions if needed.",
      "<b>Exercise Questions:</b><br>1. What does the Save command do?<br>2. When should you use the Save command?<br>3. What is the purpose of the Save As command?<br>4. When would you use Save As instead of Save?<br>5. How do you access the Save As option in most software applications?<br>6. What should you consider when choosing a file name?<br>7. Why is it important to choose the right location when saving a file?<br>8. How can you manage different versions of a file effectively?<br>9. Circle the correct statement: Save As (creates a new file / updates the existing file).<br>10. Write a file name and location for a project report called '2024 Annual Review' saved in the 'Projects' folder."
