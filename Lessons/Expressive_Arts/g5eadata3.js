Rough Carving: Begin by carving the basic shape of the spoon using a carving knife. Start with the handle and gradually shape the spoon's bowl.<br>3. Carve the Bowl of the Spoon: Use a hook knife or your regular carving knife to hollow out the bowl of the spoon. Be patient and carve out small pieces at a time.<br>4. Refining the Shape: Once the rough carving is done, refine the shape of the handle and the bowl, making the spoon smooth and even.<br>5. Smooth the Surface: Use sandpaper to smooth out the entire spoon, paying attention to the bowl and edges.<br>6. Finishing: Once the spoon is smooth, you can choose to leave it natural or apply a finish like food-safe oil to protect the wood.<br><br>Activity:<br>Demonstrate the initial steps of spoon carving, allowing students to observe how the carving tools work.
