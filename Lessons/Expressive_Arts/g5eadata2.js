      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Harmony (What is Harmony?)</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b> Learners will understand the meaning of harmony in music.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>Harmony is when two or more notes are sung or played at the same time to create a pleasing sound. In singing, harmony happens when different voices sing different notes that fit well together. Harmony makes music richer and more interesting.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>If one person sings the melody (main tune), and another person sings a different note that blends with it, they are singing in harmony.<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>Have learners share songs they know that might include harmony (e.g., church songs, traditional songs, or songs on the radio).",
      "<b>Part 2: Traditional Harmonies</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b> Learners will explore and practice traditional harmonies from their culture.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>Traditional harmonies come from our culture and are usually passed down by older generations. In African music, harmony is often created through call and response or singing in groups, where some voices go high while others go low.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>In Zambian traditional songs, some voices lead with the main tune while others respond in harmony.<br><br>Songs like “Tiyende Pamodzi” or “Mayo Wangu” may include traditional harmony.<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Sing a simple traditional song as a class and split into two groups. One group sings the melody while the other adds harmony using lower or higher notes.",
      "<b>Part 3: Popular Harmonies</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b> Learners will identify harmony in popular songs and understand how modern music uses harmony.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>Popular harmonies are found in modern songs like gospel, pop, or R&B. Artists use harmony in choruses and background vocals to make their songs sound fuller. In bands or choirs, harmony helps support the lead singer.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>Songs by groups or choirs often include harmony, like Pentatonix or Zambian Gospel Groups.<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Play a short clip of a popular song with harmony (school-appropriate).<br>Let learners listen and identify the harmony parts. Discuss how it changes the feel of the music.",
      "<b>Part 4: Singing with Harmony</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b> Learners will practice singing in harmony with a familiar song.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>Now that learners understand harmony, they will try it out. Use a familiar song and practice singing in two parts.<br><br><b>Steps:</b><br>1. Choose a simple song (e.g., a hymn or children’s song).<br>2. Teach the melody to the whole class.<br>3. Teach a simple harmony line to a second group.<br>4. Practice singing together, adjusting to make sure the voices blend.<br><br><b>Tip:</b> Use keyboard or recorded backing tracks to help learners hear the harmony better.",

It can be traditional, gospel, reggae, kalindula, or hip-hop. The style shows the mood, instruments used, and how people perform it.<br><br>Form is how a song is arranged or built. It tells us if the song has verses, a chorus, a call and response, or repetition.<br><br>Example:<br>A song with a verse, chorus, and another verse has a clear form.<br>A song that uses drums, clapping, and call-and-response is a traditional style.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Can you name some Zambian music styles?
