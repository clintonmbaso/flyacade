      "<b>Part 4: Working Together – Practice Time</b><br><br>Team Activity:<br>Give each child a small task (picking up toys, putting books away, wiping tables).<br>Encourage teamwork: “Let’s all clean up together and see how nice our classroom looks!”<br>Praise their effort: “Wow! Look how beautiful and clean our room is now. Great job, everyone!”",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Show What You Learned!</b><br><br>Tidying Up Challenge:<br>Make the room slightly messy with scattered toys and books.<br>Give children 2 minutes to clean up as a team.<br>Watch how well they follow the tidy-up rules.<br><br>Reflection Questions:<br>1. Why is it important to tidy up?<br>2. What should we do with books after reading them?<br>3. Where do we put trash?<br>4.
