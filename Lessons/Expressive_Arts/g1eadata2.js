      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sounds</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will understand what a sound is and identify its sources.<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Begin by saying, “Close your eyes and listen for 10 seconds.”<br><br>After 10 seconds, ask: “What did you hear?” (e.g., birds, people talking, a door, footsteps)<br><br>Explain: “All these are sounds. A sound is made when something vibrates or moves quickly.”<br><br><b>Key Point:</b><br>Sound is a type of energy we hear when things vibrate. We use our ears to listen.<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>“What are your favorite sounds?”<br>“Are all sounds loud?”",
      "<b>Part 2: Types of Sounds – Natural vs Artificial</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will differentiate between natural and artificial sounds.<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Show two pictures (or imitate sounds): a bird chirping and a car horn.<br><br>Ask: “Which one is made by nature? Which one is made by people?”<br><br><b>Explain:</b><br>Natural sounds come from nature (e.g., birds, wind, water, thunder).<br>Artificial sounds are man-made (e.g., cars, bells, machines, alarms).<br><br><b>Group Activity:</b><br>Learners sit in a circle. You say a sound (e.g., “rain falling”) and they say if it’s natural or artificial.",
      "<b>Part 3: Making and Exploring Sounds</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will explore how different materials can create different sounds.<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Bring simple items: a bottle with stones, a spoon and a cup, paper to crumple, a whistle.<br><br>Let learners try each object and describe the sound (loud/soft, long/short, high/low).<br><br><b>Discussion:</b><br>“Why do different objects make different sounds?”<br>“Can you make music using these items?”<br><br><b>Key Skill:</b> Encourage learners to use creativity and imagination to make new sounds.",
      "<b>Part 4: Sounds in Our Environment</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will observe and talk about the sounds around them at school or home.<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Take a walk around the school or stand at the door and listen.<br><br>Create a “sound map”: learners draw what they heard and label it (e.g., bell ringing, wind blowing).<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>“Which sounds were pleasant?”<br>“Which sounds were not nice?”<br><br><b>Emphasis:</b> Teach respect for quiet places and the importance of listening carefully.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Assessment)</b>:<br><br><b>Instructions:</b> Write the answers or point to the correct option as the teacher reads each question.<br><br>1. What is a sound?<br>a) A picture<br>b) Something we eat<br>c) Something we hear<br><br>2. Which one is a natural sound?<br>a) Car horn<br>b) Bird singing<br>c) Telephone ringing<br><br>3. Which one is artificial?<br>a) Wind blowing<br>b) Dog barking<br>c) Bell ringing<br><br>4. Circle the object that makes a sound.<br>(Provide pictures: car, ball, bell)<br><br>5. What do we use to hear?<br>a) Eyes<br>b) Nose<br>c) Ears<br><br>6. Which sound is soft?<br>a) Lion roar<br>b) Whisper<br>c) Drum<br><br>7. Which one is a loud sound?<br>a) Clock ticking<br>b) Airplane<br>c) Pencil writing<br><br>8. Name one object that makes a sound at home.<br><br>9. Draw your favorite sound.<br><br>10. What did you hear when you closed your eyes at the beginning?"

  "assessments": [
    "<b>Observation</b>: The teacher will observe learners' participation in discussions, sound activities, and drawing the sound map.",
    "<b>Exercise</b>: Learners will complete a 10-question task to assess their understanding of sound and its types."
  ],
  "conclusion": [
    "By exploring different sounds and where they come from, learners will become more aware of their environment, develop listening skills, and understand the importance of sound in daily life."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Exploration of Sounds</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners understand that exploring sounds means discovering how different sounds are made and how they can be used.<br><br>Hook Question:<br>Ask: “Can you make a sound with your body right now?” (Allow responses: clapping, stomping, humming)<br><br>Explain:<br>Sounds are all around us. We can find them in nature, from machines, or even from ourselves.<br>We can explore sounds by listening carefully and trying to make our own using objects or body parts.<br><br>Key Terms Recap:<br>Explore: To discover or learn something new.<br>Sound: What we hear when something vibrates.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sound Scavenger Hunt (Listening and Imitation)</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners identify and imitate different sounds around them.<br><br>Activity:<br>Tell learners: “Let’s go on a sound scavenger hunt!”<br>Take learners outside or around the classroom for 5 minutes to listen carefully.<br>Back in class, ask: “What sounds did you hear?” (List responses: wind, talking, birds, broom, chair moving)<br>Let learners imitate each sound with their voice or body.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Which were natural sounds?<br>Which were artificial?<br><br>TIP: Use flashcards of sound sources (bird, drum, horn) to reinforce identification.",

      "<b>Part 4: Reflection and Recap</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners reflect on what they discovered about sound creation and expression.<br><br>Discussion Questions:<br>“Which sound did you like the most?”<br>“How did your group create your sound?”<br>“Why do you think it’s important to explore sounds?”<br><br>Key Message:<br>Sound helps us communicate, express feelings, and enjoy music.

Listen and Identify:<br>The teacher makes three sounds (e.g., clapping, tapping a tin, whistling).<br>Learners write or draw the source of each sound.<br><br>2. Circle the Body Parts Used to Make Sounds:<br>a) Eyes<br>b) Mouth<br>c) Hands<br>d) Nose<br>(Correct: b and c)<br><br>3. Tick the Natural Sounds:<br>[ ] Car horn<br>[✓] Bird singing"
