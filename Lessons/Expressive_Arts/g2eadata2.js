      "<b>Part 1: Introduction – What is Sound?</b><br><br>Time: 10 minutes<br><br>Begin with a simple explanation: “Sound is something we hear. It is made when things vibrate.”<br><br>Demonstrate with a familiar example, like tapping a table or clapping hands.<br><br>Ask learners: “What sounds do you hear at home? At school?” Let a few children respond.<br><br>Emphasize that sounds can be loud or soft, high or low, and come from many sources.<br><br>Resources: Teacher’s voice, classroom objects (desk, pencil, bottle)",
      "<b>Part 2: Exploring Sound with Objects</b><br><br>Time: 15 minutes<br><br>Provide each child (or group) with objects: spoons, plastic bottles, sticks, boxes, stones, etc.<br><br>Let them tap, shake, or scrape each object to produce a sound.<br><br>Encourage them to describe what they hear: “Is it loud? Soft? Does it rattle? Knock?”<br><br>Ask: “Which object makes a louder sound?” “Which is softer?”<br><br>Emphasize that we can create different sounds by hitting, shaking, or blowing into things.<br><br>Resources: Recycled materials, musical toys, natural objects",

Example: Shake a container with stones and ask, “What do you think made this sound?”<br><br>Let students take turns creating a sound while others guess the object.<br><br>Reinforce vocabulary: loud, soft, high, low, shaking, tapping, blowing.<br><br>Resources: Hidden sound box, teacher-made sound effects",
      "<b>Part 4: Sound and Its Source</b><br><br>Time: 10 minutes<br><br>Show or play a sound (e.g., dog barking, bell ringing) and ask, “What is that sound? Where does it come from?”<br><br>Use pictures or drawings of common sound sources: animals, vehicles, instruments.<br><br>Discuss how sounds help us know what is happening around us.<br><br>Encourage children to make the sounds of the sources: pretend to be a barking dog or a hooting car.<br><br>Resources: Pictures, sound recordings, story cards",
      "<b>Part 5: Activity / Exercise</b><br><br>Time: 15 minutes<br><br>Task: Sound Hunt and Drawing<br><br>Learners go on a short sound hunt around the classroom or school yard (supervised).<br><br>They listen quietly and write down (or draw) three sounds they hear.<br><br>Back in class, each learner shares one sound and what made it.<br><br>They draw the object or animal that made the sound in their books.<br><br>Extension: Match pictures to sound sources on a worksheet.<br><br>Materials: Worksheets or drawing paper, crayons/pencils"
