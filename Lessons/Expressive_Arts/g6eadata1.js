      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Good Health Habits</b>:<br><br>Definition of good health habits: These include regular exercise, a balanced diet, proper sleep, hygiene practices, and managing stress.<br><br>Why good health habits matter: A healthy lifestyle helps us feel energetic, reduces the risk of illness, improves focus and performance in school and physical activities, and increases longevity.<br><br>Examples of good habits: Drinking enough water, eating fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, getting enough rest, and washing hands frequently.<br><br>Discussion: Ask students to share some of their own good health habits and how they feel they affect their daily lives.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Role of Proper Dress in Health and Performance</b>:<br><br>Clothing for physical activities: Wearing appropriate clothing helps to maintain comfort, flexibility, and prevent injuries. For example, wearing proper shoes for sports or comfortable clothes for exercise.<br><br>Weather-appropriate clothing: Dressing for the weather (e.g., light clothing in hot weather, warm clothing in cold weather) helps prevent heat exhaustion or hypothermia.<br><br>Hygiene and clothing: Clean and dry clothes help prevent skin infections and discomfort.<br><br>Demonstration: Ask students to consider the difference between wearing school uniform clothes versus exercise clothing for a physical activity. Discuss how their comfort would affect their ability to participate in a physical task.",
      "<b>Part 3: Inappropriate Dress and Its Impact on Performance</b>:<br><br>Inappropriate clothing for activities: Wearing the wrong clothing, like tight shoes or heavy clothes during physical activity, can lead to discomfort, injuries, or reduced performance.<br><br>Examples of performance impacts:<br>Physical performance: Not wearing the right sports gear can lead to blisters, muscle strain, or difficulty moving.<br>Cognitive performance: If students are distracted by discomfort or are too hot or cold due to inappropriate dress, it can be difficult to concentrate or participate in class.<br>Confidence and mood: Wearing the wrong clothes can make a person feel self-conscious or uncomfortable, affecting their attitude and mood.<br><br>Discussion: Have the students think about a time when they wore inappropriate clothing for an activity (e.g., wearing sandals to PE). Ask them how it affected their performance.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Connection Between Health, Dress, and Performance</b>:<br><br>Holistic approach to well-being: Maintaining good health habits, including dressing appropriately, supports overall performance in both physical and academic activities.<br><br>Healthy lifestyle as a foundation: Good nutrition, exercise, and rest enhance energy and performance, while proper dress helps ensure comfort and safety during activities.<br><br>Preventing distractions: Dressing appropriately reduces distractions and allows students to focus on their tasks, whether it's in sports, classwork, or other activities.<br><br>Group Discussion: Break students into small groups and ask them to create a 'perfect day for performance' checklist. What health habits and dress would they include to ensure they perform well in school, sports, and daily activities?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise and Application</b>:<br><br>Part 1: Students will engage in a short physical exercise (e.g., stretching, jumping jacks, or running in place). They will do this first in regular school clothes.<br>Part 2: After performing the exercise, students will then change into appropriate sportswear (e.g., comfortable shoes, T-shirts). They will perform the same physical activity again.<br>Discussion: After the exercise, ask students to reflect on how they felt during both parts of the exercise. Did they feel more comfortable or perform better in the proper attire?"

      "<b>Part 1: Understanding Rhythm</b>:<br><br>Rhythm refers to the pattern of sound and silence in music. It is organized into beats and measures, which create the structure of the music.<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b> Beat, tempo, and time signatures.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Identify the rhythm of simple melodies such as 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' using crotchets (quarter notes), quavers (eighth notes), and minims (half notes).",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Tonic-Solfa</b>:<br><br>Tonic-Solfa is a system of reading music notes using syllables (doh, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, doh).<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b><br>Each syllable represents a note in the scale.<br>The tonic (doh) is the starting note, and its position depends on the key.<br><br><b>Example:</b> C major scale in Tonic-Solfa: doh-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-doh.",
      "<b>Part 3: Transcribing Notes</b>:<br><br>Transcribing notes means converting music from one form to another (e.g., staff notation to Tonic-Solfa).<br><br><b>Steps:</b><br>1. Identify the key of the melody.<br>2. Match the notes to their Tonic-Solfa equivalents.<br>3. Maintain rhythm and note values.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>For the melody 'C-D-E-F,' transcribe as: doh-re-mi-fa.",
      "<b>Part 4: Applying Rhythm to Tonic-Solfa</b>:<br><br>Rhythm and Tonic-Solfa work together to express music. Add note values (e.g., crotchets, minims) to the Tonic-Solfa to create a full transcription.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>A melody with rhythm:<br>C (quarter note), D (half note), E (quarter note), F (quarter note).<br><br><b>Transcription:</b> doh (ta), re (taa), mi (ta), fa (ta)."

  "assessments": [
    "<b>Observation</b>: The teacher will observe students' participation in discussions and exercises.",
    "<b>Practice Exercises</b>: Students will transcribe notes from staff notation to Tonic-Solfa and apply rhythm to their transcriptions."

  "conclusion": [
    "By understanding rhythm and Tonic-Solfa, students will develop foundational skills for reading and performing music."
