Proper tension ensures that stitches are firm and secure without puckering or pulling the fabric.",
      "<b>Safety Tips When Working with Needles and Thread:</b><br><b>Needle Safety:</b> Handle needles carefully to avoid pricking yourself. Use a thimble to protect your fingers when pushing the needle through thick fabrics.<br><b>Thread Management:</b> Cut threads to a manageable length to prevent tangling. Always keep your workspace organized to avoid losing needles or creating a messy sewing environment.",
