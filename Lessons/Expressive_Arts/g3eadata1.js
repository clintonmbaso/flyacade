    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Posture</b>:<br><br>Posture is the way you position your body when you sit, stand, or move. Good posture helps you stay comfortable and healthy. It ensures that your muscles and joints are aligned properly, which can reduce back pain, muscle strain, and improve overall body balance. Poor posture can lead to discomfort and health problems over time, so it's important to practice good posture daily.<br><br>Activity:<br>Show students examples of good and bad posture. For example, standing tall with shoulders back versus slouching. Ask the class which one they think is better for their health and why.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sit-Ups and Flat Surfaces</b>:<br><br>One of the key components of good posture is having a strong core (the muscles around your abdomen and lower back). When you strengthen these muscles, it helps you maintain a straight and stable posture. Sit-ups are a great exercise for building core strength.<br><br>Activity:<br>Have the students lie down on a flat surface, with their knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Instruct them to place their hands behind their heads and lift their upper bodies toward their knees, keeping their elbows wide. Perform 10-15 sit-ups together as a class. Remind them to keep their back straight during the exercise to prevent injury.",
      "<b>Part 3: Stretches for Flexibility</b>:<br><br>Stretching helps keep your muscles flexible and reduces tension, which is important for maintaining good posture. Stretching also helps prevent injury and can relieve tightness from sitting or standing for long periods.<br><br>Activity:<br>Lead the students through some basic stretches:<br>Reach for the Sky: Stand up tall and reach your arms toward the ceiling, stretching your body.<br>Forward Bend: While standing, bend forward at the waist and try to touch your toes. Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds.<br>Side Stretch: Raise one arm above your head and gently lean to the opposite side, stretching your side muscles. Hold for 10-15 seconds on each side.",
      "<b>Part 4: Bends and Rolls</b>:<br><br>Bending and rolling exercises help improve flexibility in your spine and hips, which supports proper posture. A flexible spine allows for better movement and helps prevent discomfort when sitting or standing.<br><br>Activity:<br>Guide the students through these exercises:<br>Standing Bends: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Gently bend at the waist, reaching down to touch your toes or the floor. Hold for a few seconds and then slowly return to standing.<br>Rolling on the Floor: Students can lie down on their backs and practice gently rolling their bodies from side to side. This movement helps improve spinal flexibility and body awareness.",
      "<b>Part 5: Class Exercise</b>:<br><br>Reinforce key concepts and assess student understanding through questions and participation.<br><br>Questions:<br>1. What is posture?<br>Answer: The way you position your body when sitting, standing, or moving.<br>2. Name one benefit of good posture.<br>Answer: It helps reduce back pain and improves body balance.<br>3. Which exercise helps to strengthen your core muscles?<br>Answer: Sit-ups."
