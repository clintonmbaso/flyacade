      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Saws</b>:<br><br>Begin the lesson by explaining what a saw is: a tool used for cutting wood or timber. Discuss how saws have sharp teeth or blades that help them cut through timber. Ask students if they’ve ever seen or used a saw before, and if so, what they used it for. Introduce the idea that different saws are designed for different types of cuts and timber.",
      "<b>Part 2: Different Types of Saws</b>:<br><br>Explain the two main types of saws used for cutting timber: crosscut saws and tenon saws.<br><br>Crosscut Saw: This saw is used for cutting across the grain of the timber. The teeth are designed in such a way that they make cutting through the wood easier.<br><br>Tenon Saw: A tenon saw is used for precise, straight cuts, especially when working on smaller pieces of timber. It’s often used to cut joints in carpentry.<br><br>You can show pictures or, if possible, bring the actual saws to class to give students a visual understanding of the differences.",
      "<b>Part 3: When and Why Each Saw is Used</b>:<br><br>Next, explain the specific purposes and scenarios in which each saw is best used:<br><br>Crosscut Saw is ideal when cutting long pieces of wood or timber into smaller sections. It's useful for cutting logs or beams where the grain of the wood goes across the cut.<br><br>Tenon Saw is more precise and used for detailed work, like cutting joints or making straight edges. It is typically used by carpenters who need to make more exact cuts.<br><br>You can describe some situations where these saws would be useful (e.g., a carpenter building a wooden chair might use a tenon saw for the joints, while a builder might use a crosscut saw to cut long timber).",
      "<b>Part 4: Safety with Saws</b>:<br><br>It is important for students to understand that saws can be dangerous if not used correctly. Explain the safety rules for using a saw, such as:<br><br>Always wear safety goggles and gloves.<br><br>Keep your hands clear of the cutting area.<br><br>Work in a well-lit space and make sure the wood is stable.<br><br>Use a sawing bench or surface to hold the timber in place.<br><br>Always cut away from your body.<br><br>Discuss the importance of being careful and following these safety rules when using any tool, especially a saw.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Saw Identification and Usage</b>:<br><br>1. Saw Identification: Provide students with pictures of different types of saws (crosscut, tenon, etc.). Ask them to identify the saw and match it with its purpose (e.g., 'This saw is used for cutting across the grain of the wood').<br><br>2. Discussion: Have students share where they might use each saw in different scenarios (e.g., building a treehouse, making furniture).<br><br>3. Practical Demonstration (Optional): If possible, demonstrate how to use each saw (or show a video) so that students can see the differences in action.<br><br>4.
