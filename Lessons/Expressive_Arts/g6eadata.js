      "<b>Part 1: Understanding Rhythm</b>:<br><br>Rhythm refers to the pattern of sound and silence in music. It is organized into beats and measures, which create the structure of the music.<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b> Beat, tempo, and time signatures.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Identify the rhythm of simple melodies such as 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' using crotchets (quarter notes), quavers (eighth notes), and minims (half notes).",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Tonic-Solfa</b>:<br><br>Tonic-Solfa is a system of reading music notes using syllables (doh, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, doh).<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b><br>Each syllable represents a note in the scale.<br>The tonic (doh) is the starting note, and its position depends on the key.<br><br><b>Example:</b> C major scale in Tonic-Solfa: doh-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-doh.",
      "<b>Part 3: Transcribing Notes</b>:<br><br>Transcribing notes means converting music from one form to another (e.g., staff notation to Tonic-Solfa).<br><br><b>Steps:</b><br>1. Identify the key of the melody.<br>2. Match the notes to their Tonic-Solfa equivalents.<br>3. Maintain rhythm and note values.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>For the melody 'C-D-E-F,' transcribe as: doh-re-mi-fa.",
      "<b>Part 4: Applying Rhythm to Tonic-Solfa</b>:<br><br>Rhythm and Tonic-Solfa work together to express music. Add note values (e.g., crotchets, minims) to the Tonic-Solfa to create a full transcription.<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>A melody with rhythm:<br>C (quarter note), D (half note), E (quarter note), F (quarter note).<br><br><b>Transcription:</b> doh (ta), re (taa), mi (ta), fa (ta)."

  "assessments": [
    "<b>Observation</b>: The teacher will observe students' participation in discussions and exercises.",
    "<b>Practice Exercises</b>: Students will transcribe notes from staff notation to Tonic-Solfa and apply rhythm to their transcriptions."
  ],
  "conclusion": [
    "By understanding rhythm and Tonic-Solfa, students will develop foundational skills for reading and performing music."
