Some are used to cure diseases, while others help with pain or prevent illness.<br><br>Ask:<br>Have you ever taken medicine when you were sick?<br>Who gave it to you?<br>Did it help you feel better?<br><br>Note: Some drugs are good for us when used properly and given by a doctor or parent, but some drugs are harmful when misused.",

These pieces can become soil over time.<br><br>Key Point:<br>Weathering is the process where rocks break down into small bits to form soil.",
"<b>Part 2: Types of Weathering (Simplified)</b>:<br><br>1. Physical Weathering – When rocks break apart due to wind, rain, or changes in temperature.<br><br>Example: When water enters a crack in a rock and then freezes, it can break the rock.<br><br>2. Chemical Weathering – When rainwater mixes with chemicals in the rock and makes it break.<br><br>Example: Rain with acid slowly wears away rock.<br><br>3. Biological Weathering – When plants or animals help break rocks.<br><br>Example: Roots of a plant growing into a crack in a rock can split it apart.<br><br>Activity: Show images or short video clips of each type.",
"<b>Part 3: Why Weathering is Important</b>:<br><br>Weathering helps make soil, which plants grow in.<br><br>It also shapes the land around us—like hills and valleys.<br><br>Without weathering, there would be no soil for farming or plants.<br><br>Class Discussion Questions:<br>What do you think would happen if there was no soil?<br>Why do you think plants need weathered rocks?",

      "<b>Part 1: What Are Invertebrates?</b>:<br><br>Invertebrates are animals that do not have a backbone or spine.<br>Most animals on Earth are invertebrates.<br><br>Examples include:<br>Worms<br>Spiders<br>Insects (like ants, flies, and butterflies)<br><br>🐛 Key Point: Invertebrates are animals without a backbone.",
      "<b>Part 2: Types of Invertebrates</b>:<br><br>1. Worms<br>Long, soft bodies without legs.<br>Live in soil or water.<br>Help break down dead plants and animals to make soil healthy.<br><br>2. Spiders<br>Have eight legs.<br>Make webs to catch insects for food.<br>Are helpful because they eat pests.<br><br>3. Insects<br>Have six legs and usually two antennae.<br>Many have wings.<br>Examples: ants, bees, butterflies, flies.<br><br>🐜 Key Point: Worms, spiders, and insects are common types of invertebrates with different features.",
      "<b>Part 3: Characteristics of Invertebrates</b>:<br><br>They do not have a backbone.<br>Their bodies are often soft or covered with a hard outer shell (exoskeleton).<br>Most have many legs or none (like worms).<br>They live in many places: soil, water, plants, and inside other animals.<br>They reproduce by laying eggs.<br><br>🕷️ Key Point: Invertebrates have different body structures but share the fact that they have no backbone.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of Invertebrates</b>:<br><br>Invertebrates are very important because:<br>They help break down dead plants and animals, cleaning the environment.<br>Many insects help pollinate flowers so plants can make fruits.<br>Spiders control insect pests by eating them.<br>Worms help make soil healthy for plants to grow.<br>Some insects like bees make honey which people use as food.<br><br>🌿 Key Point: Invertebrates help keep nature balanced and are useful to people.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Living Places (Habitats)</b>:<br><br>All animals and plants live in places that meet their needs for food, water, air, and shelter. These places are called habitats.<br><br>Examples of habitats:<br>Land (like forests, soil, plains, and moulds)<br>Water (like ponds, rivers, and seas)<br><br>🌍 Key Point: A habitat is a place where a plant or animal lives and grows.",
      "<b>Part 2: Land Habitats</b>:<br><br>1. Forests<br>Have many trees and plants.<br>Animals like monkeys, birds, and snakes live here.<br><br>2. Soil (Underground)<br>Some animals live under the ground, like worms, ants, and moles.<br>Plants grow roots deep in the soil.<br><br>3. Plains<br>Flat, grassy land where animals like zebras, cows, and lions live.<br>Plants like grass and shrubs grow here.<br><br>4. Moulds (Rotting plant material)<br>Found on the ground in damp places.<br>Tiny animals like insects and fungi live and feed here.<br><br>🌳 Key Point: Land habitats can be forests, soil, plains, or moulds, each with special plants and animals.",
      "<b>Part 3: Water Habitats</b>:<br><br>1. Ponds<br>Small bodies of still water.<br>Animals: frogs, insects, and small fish.<br>Plants: lily pads, reeds.<br><br>2. Rivers<br>Flowing water.<br>Animals: fish, otters, crocodiles.<br>Plants: water grass, reeds.<br><br>3. Seas<br>Large bodies of salty water.<br>Animals: whales, sharks, jellyfish.<br>Plants: seaweed, algae.<br><br>🐠 Key Point: Water habitats include ponds, rivers, and seas where plants and animals live and grow.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of Habitats</b>:<br><br>Habitats are important because:<br>They give animals and plants what they need to survive.<br>They protect living things from danger.<br>Different animals and plants are suited to different places.<br><br>🌱 Key Point: Every plant and animal has a special home (habitat) where it can grow well and stay safe.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>A. Fill in the blanks (Choose from: pond, forest, soil, sea, plains):<br>1. A __________ is a home for big trees, birds, and monkeys.<br>2. Fish and seaweed live in the __________.<br>3. Frogs and insects can be found in a __________.<br>4. Worms and roots are found in the __________.<br>5.
