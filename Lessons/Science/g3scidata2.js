Some are used to cure diseases, while others help with pain or prevent illness.<br><br>Ask:<br>Have you ever taken medicine when you were sick?<br>Who gave it to you?<br>Did it help you feel better?<br><br>Note: Some drugs are good for us when used properly and given by a doctor or parent, but some drugs are harmful when misused.",

"<b>Part 1: Introduction to Weathering</b>:<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Begin by asking learners: “Have you ever seen a big rock broken into smaller pieces?”<br><br>Show pictures or real examples of rocks and soil.<br><br>Explain: Weathering is the breaking up of rocks into smaller pieces. These pieces can become soil over time.<br><br>Key Point:<br>Weathering is the process where rocks break down into small bits to form soil.",
"<b>Part 2: Types of Weathering (Simplified)</b>:<br><br>1. Physical Weathering – When rocks break apart due to wind, rain, or changes in temperature.<br><br>Example: When water enters a crack in a rock and then freezes, it can break the rock.<br><br>2. Chemical Weathering – When rainwater mixes with chemicals in the rock and makes it break.<br><br>Example: Rain with acid slowly wears away rock.<br><br>3. Biological Weathering – When plants or animals help break rocks.<br><br>Example: Roots of a plant growing into a crack in a rock can split it apart.<br><br>Activity: Show images or short video clips of each type.",
"<b>Part 3: Why Weathering is Important</b>:<br><br>Weathering helps make soil, which plants grow in.<br><br>It also shapes the land around us—like hills and valleys.<br><br>Without weathering, there would be no soil for farming or plants.<br><br>Class Discussion Questions:<br>What do you think would happen if there was no soil?<br>Why do you think plants need weathered rocks?",
"<b>Part 4: Everyday Examples of Weathering</b>:<br><br>Cracks in a pavement after winter<br><br>Sand on a beach (broken down rock)<br><br>Soil in your school garden<br><br>Mini Demonstration (optional):<br>Rub two stones together—see how small bits fall off.<br>Soak chalk in water overnight—observe how it changes (shows weathering).",

Wind<br>Strong winds blow sand and dust that scratch and wear away rocks.<br>Example: Rocks in the desert slowly lose their shape due to wind.<br><br>2. Water<br>Rain, rivers, and waves hit rocks, causing them to crack and break over time.<br>Example: Waves hitting rocks at the beach.<br><br>3. Trees (Roots)<br>Plant roots grow into small cracks in rocks. As roots grow bigger, they break the rock.<br>Example: A small plant growing in a rock wall.<br><br>4. Animals<br>Animals like moles or earthworms dig the soil, moving and breaking small rocks.<br>Example: A rabbit digging a hole in the ground.",
