Use real-life examples like dogs, cats, birds, or fish.<br><br>Explain:<br>Animals are living things. They breathe, grow, move, and need food and water to stay alive. Unlike plants, animals cannot make their own food, so they must eat.<br><br>Use visuals or real-life objects: Show pictures of familiar animals.<br><br>Key points to cover:<br>Animals are living organisms.<br>They move, eat food, and drink water.<br>They grow and can have babies.",

Some are small, like ants, and others are large, like elephants. Some live in water (fish), some on land (lions), and some in the sky (birds).<br><br>Use visuals or flashcards: Show pictures of:<br>A fish (ocean)<br>A lion (land)<br>An eagle (air)<br>A polar bear (cold environment)<br><br>Key points to cover:<br>Animals are everywhere — forests, rivers, oceans, deserts, and mountains.<br>They look different and live in different environments.",

Guide the discussion towards the idea that the nose is not just for smelling but has other important jobs.<br><br>Features of the Nose:<br>Nostrils: The openings through which air enters and exits.<br>Nasal Passage: The space inside the nose where air travels.<br>Nose Hairs: Small hairs that trap dust and dirt from the air before it enters the lungs.<br>Septum: The part inside the nose that separates the two nostrils.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Function of the Nose in Breathing</b>:<br><br>Breathing Through the Nose: Explain that the nose helps us breathe. Air enters through the nostrils and travels through the nasal passages to the lungs.<br><br>Benefits of Breathing Through the Nose:<br>The air is warmed and moistened before reaching the lungs.<br>The nose filters out dust, pollen, and germs using tiny hairs and mucus.<br>Breathing through the nose also helps us smell things better.",
      "<b>Part 3: The Function of the Nose in Smelling</b>:<br><br>How We Smell: Explain that the nose helps us smell by detecting different odors. Inside the nose, there are special cells that send signals to the brain when they detect smells.<br><br>The Importance of Smell:<br>Discuss how smell helps us enjoy food, stay safe (e.g., detecting smoke or a bad smell), and remember things (smells can remind us of places or people).",
      "<b>Part 4: The Nose's Role in Protecting the Body</b>:<br><br>Nose as a Protector: The nose helps protect our body by filtering out harmful particles like dust and germs before they reach the lungs. The nose hairs and mucus in the nasal passages trap these particles.<br><br>Cleansing Action: The mucus produced in the nose also helps trap dust, bacteria, and other harmful substances, preventing them from reaching deeper into the respiratory system.",

Ask them to label the parts of the nose (nostrils, nasal passage, septum, nose hairs) and match them to their functions. For example, the nostrils are where air enters, and the nose hairs filter dust.<br><br>Class Discussion: After the activity, go over the answers as a class. Encourage students to share what they learned about each part of the nose and its function.<br><br>Reflection: Ask the students to think about the different things they can smell and how the nose helps them with those experiences. Can they name something they smell right now? Why is the nose so important?"

      "<b>Part 2: How the Stomach Works (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Functions of the Stomach – Breaking Down Food:<br>Explain that the stomach has two main jobs:<br>1. Mixing food: The stomach muscles squeeze and churn the food to break it into smaller pieces.<br>2. Adding stomach juices: The stomach makes special juices called acid and enzymes, which help dissolve food into a paste called chyme.<br><br>Use a simple analogy: The stomach is like a washing machine, mixing everything inside to make it ready for the next step.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Show a video or animation of how food moves from the mouth to the stomach and how the stomach churns the food.",

There are two main parts: the small intestine and the large intestine.<br><br>Small Intestine: The long, coiled tube where most digestion and absorption of food happen.<br>Large Intestine: The wider tube where water is absorbed and waste is prepared to leave the body.<br><br>Why Do We Need the Intestines?<br>The intestines help process the food we eat and give our bodies the nutrients it needs to grow and stay healthy.",
      "<b>Part 2: Function of the Small Intestine</b>:<br><br>Digestion:<br>After food leaves the stomach, it enters the small intestine. In the small intestine, food is broken down further by digestive juices, and nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and sugars are absorbed by tiny hair-like structures called villi.<br><br>Nutrient Absorption:<br>The villi help the body absorb the nutrients from food into the bloodstream. These nutrients are then carried to different parts of the body where they are used for energy, growth, and repair.",
      "<b>Part 3: Function of the Large Intestine</b>:<br><br>Absorption of Water:<br>Once the small intestine has absorbed most of the nutrients, the leftover food moves into the large intestine. Here, the large intestine absorbs most of the water from the remaining food.<br><br>Waste Formation:<br>The remaining waste, which now becomes solid, is then moved into the rectum and later leaves the body through the anus.",

True or False: The small intestine is where most of the digestion and absorption of food happens. (True)<br>2. Fill in the blank: The large intestine absorbs _______ from the food that is left over.
