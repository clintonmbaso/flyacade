The pinna captures sound waves and directs them into the ear canal towards the eardrum.",
      "<b>Middle Ear</b>: The middle ear contains three tiny bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). When sound waves hit the eardrum, it vibrates, causing the ossicles to move and amplify the sound vibrations, sending them to the inner ear.",
      "<b>Inner Ear</b>: The inner ear contains the cochlea, a fluid-filled structure lined with hair cells. The vibrations from the middle ear cause the fluid in the cochlea to move, which in turn moves the hair cells. These movements generate electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve.",

  activities: [
    ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    [
      "<b>Behavior of Sound in Open Spaces</b>: In open spaces, sound waves can travel freely without many obstacles. This allows the sound to spread out and become less intense as it travels further. <br><br><strong>Example</strong>: When you shout in an open field, your voice will not sound as loud as it does in a small room because the sound waves are dispersed.",
      "<b>Behavior of Sound in Closed Rooms</b>: In closed rooms, sound waves reflect off walls, floors, and ceilings. This can cause the sound to be louder or to overlap with itself, creating effects like echoes or reverberations.",
      "<b>Echoes</b>: An echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener's ears after a delay. This occurs when sound waves bounce off a distant surface and return to the listener. <br><br><strong>Example</strong>: Shouting in a large empty hall or near a cliff can produce an echo, where you hear your voice repeated after a brief moment.",
      "<b>Reverberations</b>: Reverberation is the persistence of sound in a space after the original sound is produced. Unlike an echo, which is a distinct repetition, reverberation creates a continuous, fading sound as the sound waves reflect multiple times within a room. <br><br><strong>Example</strong>: Clapping your hands in a large empty room can create a reverberation, where the sound lingers and fades out slowly.",
