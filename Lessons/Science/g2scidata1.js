Examples of living things include animals, plants, and people. These things are all alive because they show these characteristics.",

For example, a seed grows into a plant, or a baby animal grows into an adult.<br><br>Example: A caterpillar grows bigger as it eats and later transforms into a butterfly.",
      "<b>Part 2: Reproduction</b>:<br><br>All living organisms reproduce to ensure the survival of their species. This can occur through various methods, such as sexual or asexual reproduction. Reproduction allows for the creation of offspring that are similar to their parents.<br><br>Example: Dogs give birth to puppies, and plants produce seeds that grow into new plants.",
      "<b>Part 3: Movement</b>:<br><br>Living things are capable of movement, whether it is their whole body or just parts of them. Movement can occur for various reasons, such as finding food, escaping danger, or changing position in response to their environment.<br><br>Example: A fish swims in water, or a tree moves its leaves in response to wind or sunlight.",
      "<b>Part 4: Response to Stimuli</b>:<br><br>Living organisms respond to stimuli in their environment. This includes physical or chemical changes, such as light, temperature, sound, or touch. These responses help organisms survive and adapt to their surroundings.<br><br>Example: A plant grows towards sunlight (phototropism), or an animal moves away when it feels threatened.",

How do living things grow differently?",

For example, plants (producers) use sunlight to grow, and animals (consumers) eat the plants for energy.<br><br>Simple Food Chain Example:<br>Sunlight → Grass (Producer) → Rabbit (Primary Consumer) → Fox (Secondary Consumer).<br><br>In this chain, sunlight is a non-living thing that helps plants grow, and animals depend on the plants and each other for food.", "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>1.
