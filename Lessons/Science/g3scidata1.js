      "<b>Part 1: Introduction (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Begin by asking the students what they know about living and non-living things. Write their responses on the whiteboard.<br>Define 'living' as things that have the ability to grow, reproduce, and respond to stimuli. Non-living things, on the other hand, do not have these abilities.",
      "<b>Part 2: Characteristics of Living Things (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Discuss the basic characteristics of living things:<br>- Growth: Living things can grow and get bigger over time.<br>- Reproduction: They can produce offspring of the same kind.<br>- Response to Stimuli: Living things can respond to changes in their environment.<br>Use simple examples to illustrate these characteristics (e.g., a plant growing, animals having babies, and humans reacting to a loud noise).",
      "<b>Part 3: Examples (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Show pictures or objects that represent living and non-living things. Have students identify and discuss which category each item falls into and why.<br>Encourage students to provide examples, and discuss as a class.",
      "<b>Part 4: Activity (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Distribute printed worksheets with questions about living and non-living things.<br>Have students work individually or in pairs to answer the questions. Questions could include:<br>- 'Is a bicycle living or non-living? Why?'<br>- 'Name one example of a living thing that can grow.'<br>- 'What is one way a living thing responds to a change in its environment?'<br>Review the answers together as a class.",
      "<b>Part 5: Conclusion</b>:<br><br>Summarize the lesson by revisiting the characteristics of living things and their differences from non-living things.<br>Encourage students to look around their environment at home and identify living and non-living things."

    "<b>Observation</b>: The teacher will observe students' participation during discussions and examples.",
    "<b>Worksheet</b>: The completed worksheets will be reviewed to evaluate students' understanding of living and non-living things."

  "conclusion": [
    "By understanding the characteristics of living and non-living things, students will be able to categorize their surroundings and recognize the unique traits of living things."
