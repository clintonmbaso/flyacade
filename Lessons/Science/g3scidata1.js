      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Mouth</b>:<br><br>Begin by discussing the mouth as an important part of the body. Ask students to think about what they use their mouth for and share their thoughts.<br><br>The mouth is where food enters the body. It’s made up of several parts, such as the lips, teeth, tongue, and gums.<br><br>The mouth is used to chew food, speak, and help in breathing.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Teeth and Their Function</b>:<br><br>Explain the structure and function of teeth:<br><br>Teeth are located inside the mouth. Humans have 20 baby teeth (deciduous teeth) that fall out and are replaced by 32 adult teeth.<br><br>Teeth are important for chewing food so we can digest it properly. There are different types of teeth, each with a special job:<br>Incisors (front teeth) are sharp and used to cut food.<br>Canines (pointed teeth) are used to tear food.<br>Molars (flat teeth) are used to grind and crush food.",
      "<b>Part 3: How Teeth Help with Digestion</b>:<br><br>Explain how teeth play a role in the digestive process:<br><br>Teeth break down food into smaller pieces, making it easier for the stomach to digest.<br><br>The chewing process also mixes food with saliva, which helps start the digestion process before the food even reaches the stomach.",
      "<b>Part 4: Taking Care of Our Teeth</b>:<br><br>Discuss the importance of keeping teeth clean:<br><br>Brushing teeth at least twice a day helps to remove food and plaque that can cause tooth decay.<br><br>Flossing helps clean between teeth where a toothbrush may not reach.<br><br>Eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables is good for your teeth.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Teeth Sorting Game</b>:<br><br>Objective: Reinforce students' understanding of different types of teeth and their functions.<br><br>1. Materials needed: Flashcards or pictures of different foods (e.g., apple, steak, bread, ice cream).<br><br>2. Instructions:<br>Show each food picture and ask students to guess which type of teeth would be used to eat the food.<br>Discuss why certain teeth are better for cutting, tearing, or grinding specific foods.<br>As a class, sort the food pictures into three categories: foods for incisors, canines, and molars.<br><br>3. Wrap-up: Ask students to explain which teeth they use to eat their favorite foods and why."

Humans have different types of teeth that perform different jobs.<br><br>Key Points:<br>Teeth are hard, white structures in our mouths.<br>Humans have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: baby teeth (primary) and adult teeth (permanent).<br>The total number of teeth in an adult mouth is 32, and they are used for biting, chewing, and grinding food.",
      "<b>Part 2: Types of Teeth</b>:<br><br>There are four main types of teeth, each designed for a specific function:<br><br>Incisors: The front teeth, sharp and flat, are used for cutting food. They are the first teeth that appear.<br>Canines (Cuspids): These are the pointed teeth next to the incisors, used for tearing food.<br>Premolars (Bicuspids): Located next to the canines, these teeth are flatter and used for grinding and crushing food.<br>Molars: These are the large teeth at the back of the mouth. They have a large surface area and are used for grinding food into smaller pieces to help with digestion.",
      "<b>Part 3: Functions of Teeth</b>:<br><br>Each type of tooth plays a specific role:<br><br>Incisors: They help in cutting and slicing food, such as vegetables or fruits.<br>Canines: These teeth are sharp and strong, helping to tear meat or tougher foods.<br>Premolars: They help to crush and grind softer foods like bread and fruits.<br>Molars: These teeth are the main grinders, helping to crush and mash food, such as meat, nuts, or grains, into smaller pieces for digestion.",
      "<b>Part 4: Caring for Teeth</b>:<br><br>Brushing teeth regularly helps to remove food and plaque (a sticky layer of bacteria).<br>Use fluoride toothpaste and brush for two minutes, twice a day (morning and night).<br>Flossing between teeth helps clean areas that toothbrushes can't reach.<br>Eating healthy foods and limiting sugary snacks is important for keeping teeth strong and preventing cavities.<br>Regular visits to the dentist help keep teeth healthy and clean.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Nose</b>:<br><br>Discussion: Start by asking the students: What do we use our nose for? Encourage answers like breathing, smelling, or any other ideas students may have. Afterward, introduce the two main functions of the nose: smelling and breathing.<br><br>The nose is a very important part of our body, and it helps us in different ways. It helps us breathe in oxygen, which is essential for life, and it helps us smell different things like flowers, food, and even danger like smoke.",
      "<b>Part 2: Breathing Through the Nose</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Explain to the students that the nose is the main organ used for breathing. When we breathe through our nose, the air we inhale is filtered by tiny hairs inside the nose called cilia. These hairs trap dirt, dust, and bacteria, preventing them from entering our lungs.<br><br>Activity: Ask the students to take a deep breath through their nose and explain how they feel. You can also demonstrate how the nose filters the air by showing a cotton ball and blowing air through it to simulate filtering.",
      "<b>Part 3: Smelling with the Nose</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Next, talk about how the nose helps us smell. Inside the nose, there are special cells called olfactory cells. These cells send signals to the brain that help us recognize different smells. The brain then tells us whether a smell is pleasant, unpleasant, or dangerous.<br><br>Discussion: Give examples of different smells and ask the students what they think of those smells (e.g., flowers, chocolate, smoke). Discuss how our nose can help us recognize dangerous smells like smoke or rotten food, which could warn us of danger.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Nose and Its Connection to Health</b>:<br><br>Explanation: The nose is also important for keeping us healthy. It warms and moistens the air we breathe, which helps protect the lungs. When we breathe through the mouth instead of the nose, the air is not filtered or warmed, which can lead to problems like sore throats or colds.<br><br>Demonstration: Explain how people breathe differently when they have a cold or blocked nose, and why it's important to keep our noses clean and healthy.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Activity 1: Matching Game: Create a set of cards with images and labels (e.g., a picture of a nose, a pair of lungs, a flower, and a dust cloud). Ask the students to match the pictures with the correct labels (nose → breathing, flower → smelling, lungs → breathing, dust cloud → breathing).<br><br>Activity 2: Breathing Practice: Have students close their eyes and take five deep breaths in and out through their noses. Discuss how they feel after breathing deeply and how their noses help with breathing.<br><br>Activity 3: Smell Test: Use various items with distinct smells (e.g., vanilla, lemon, or mint) and have the students close their eyes and smell them. Ask them to guess what they are smelling and discuss how the nose helps them identify the smells."

      "<b>Part 3: Functions of the Nose</b>:<br><br><b>Smell:</b> The nose contains sensory receptors that detect smells. These receptors send signals to the brain, allowing us to identify different scents.<br><b>Breathing:</b> The nose helps warm, filter, and moisten the air we breathe before it reaches the lungs.<br><b>Tasting:</b> The nose also helps with taste because much of what we taste is influenced by our sense of smell.",
      "<b>Part 4: Fun Facts about the Nose</b>:<br><br>Did you know that each person has a unique smell? Our noses help us recognize different scents, including our favorite foods or the smell of fresh flowers.<br>The average person can identify over 1 trillion different smells!",

Provide students with a printed image of the nose (or draw a simple diagram on the board).<br>2. Ask students to work in pairs or small groups to label the different parts of the nose based on what they have learned.<br>3. After labeling, have students share their answers with the class and explain the function of each part.<br>Extension Activity (Optional): Have students draw their own version of the nose and label the parts. They can add creative elements, such as noses on animals, and discuss how their noses are adapted for different purposes (e.g., a dog's nose is much stronger at detecting smells than ours)."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Bones (What are Bones?)</b>:<br><br>Explanation:<br>Bones are hard structures inside our body that give us shape and support. The human body has 206 bones. Together, they form the skeletal system.<br><br>Key Points:<br>- Bones are strong but light.<br>- They are made of a hard outer layer and a spongy inside.<br>- Some bones are big (like the thigh bone), while others are tiny (like the bones in the ear).<br><br>Activity:<br>Show a simple skeleton diagram and ask students to name parts of their bodies where they feel hard bones.",
      "<b>Part 2: Bones Provide Support and Shape</b>:<br><br>Explanation:<br>Bones act like a frame for our body. Without bones, our body would be floppy, like jelly. They give our body its shape.<br><br>Example:<br>The skull protects the head, and the spine helps us stand tall.<br><br>Demonstration:<br>Bring a piece of cardboard and a soft piece of cloth.

Crack it open to explain how a hard covering (like bones) protects what’s inside.",
      "<b>Part 4: Bones Help Us Move</b>:<br><br>Explanation:<br>Bones work with muscles to help us move. Joints (where two bones meet) allow different kinds of movements like bending, turning, or stretching.<br><br>Key Examples:<br>- Knees and elbows bend.<br>- Hips and shoulders allow rotation.<br>- Fingers and toes help us grab or hold things.<br><br>Movement Game:<br>Ask students to point out which joints are moving when they walk, wave, or jump.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Human Skeleton</b>:<br><br>Start by asking the students if they know what a skeleton is and what its purpose is. Briefly explain that the skeleton is made up of bones that give the body its shape and protect internal organs.<br><br>Key Concepts to Cover:<br>The skeleton has 206 bones in total.<br>The bones come together to form the skeleton, which provides structure, protection, and allows us to move.<br>The skeleton is divided into two main parts: Axial Skeleton and Appendicular Skeleton.",
      "<b>Part 2: Major Parts of the Human Skeleton</b>:<br><br><b>Axial Skeleton:</b><br>The skull: Protects the brain, eyes, and ears.<br>The spine (vertebral column): A series of bones (vertebrae) that support the body and protect the spinal cord.<br>The ribs: Protect the heart and lungs.<br>The sternum (breastbone): Located in the center of the chest, it helps protect the heart and lungs.<br><br><b>Appendicular Skeleton:</b><br>Shoulder girdles (clavicles and scapulae): Connect the arms to the body.<br>Arms (humerus, radius, ulna): Enable arm movements.<br>Pelvis: Supports the spine and connects the lower body to the upper body.<br>Legs (femur, tibia, fibula): Allow movement and support the body’s weight.<br>Hands and feet (carpals, metacarpals, phalanges): Help with gripping, walking, and balance.",
      "<b>Part 3: Function and Importance of the Skeleton</b>:<br><br>Support: The skeleton provides a frame that supports the body and helps it maintain shape.<br>Protection: The bones protect vital organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribs protect the heart and lungs, and the spine protects the spinal cord.<br>Movement: The skeleton works with muscles and joints to help the body move. Without bones, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, or run.<br>Storage of minerals: Bones store minerals like calcium, which are important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.",
      "<b>Part 4: How the Skeleton Grows and Changes</b>:<br><br>Explain that as we grow, our bones grow too. Babies are born with about 270 bones, but as they grow, some of these bones fuse together, and by the time they reach adulthood, they have 206 bones. This process is important for making the skeleton strong and functional.",
