      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Forces</b>:<br><br>Definition: A force is a push or pull acting upon an object as a result of its interaction with another object. Forces can affect an object's motion by causing it to start moving, stop moving, or change direction.",
      "<b>Part 2: Balanced Forces</b>:<br><br>Definition: Balanced forces occur when two forces acting on an object are equal in size but opposite in direction. In such cases, there is no change in the object's motion.<br><br>Explanation:<br>If an object is stationary, it will remain at rest under balanced forces.<br>If an object is moving, it will continue to move at the same speed and in the same direction (constant velocity) under balanced forces.<br><br>Example:<br>A book resting on a table is a good example of balanced forces. The gravitational force pulling the book downward is balanced by the normal force from the table pushing upward. As a result, the book stays still.",
      "<b>Part 3: Unbalanced Forces</b>:<br><br>Definition: Unbalanced forces occur when the forces acting on an object are not equal in size. This results in a change in the object's motion, such as starting to move, stopping, or changing direction.<br><br>Explanation:<br>Unbalanced forces cause acceleration, meaning the object will speed up, slow down, or change direction based on the direction and strength of the unbalanced force.<br><br>Example:<br>When you push a toy car with enough force, it will overcome the frictional force resisting its movement, and the car will move. In this case, the force you apply is greater than the friction, making the forces unbalanced, which causes the car to accelerate.",
      "<b>Part 4: Comparing Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</b>:<br><br>Explanation:<br>Balanced forces result in no change in an object's motion, while unbalanced forces cause a change in speed, direction, or both. Understanding this difference helps us predict how objects move in different situations.",
      "<b>Part 5: Practical Activity</b>:<br><br>Materials: Small toy cars, books, rulers, and wooden boards.<br><br>Activity Steps:<br>1. Balanced Forces Demonstration: Place a book on a table and observe. Discuss why the book stays still (balanced forces).<br>2. Unbalanced Forces Demonstration: Push a toy car on a flat surface and observe how it moves. Discuss how the push overcomes friction (unbalanced forces).<br><br>Discussion Questions:<br>Why does the book stay on the table without moving?<br>What happens when you stop pushing the toy car?

Discuss how friction plays an important role in safety and movement.",
