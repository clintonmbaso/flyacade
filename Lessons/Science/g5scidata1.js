      "<b>Part 3: Measuring the Pulse</b>:<br><br>Demonstrate how to measure the pulse:<br>- Once the students locate their pulse, ask them to count the number of beats they feel in 15 seconds.<br>- Multiply this number by 4 to get the pulse rate in beats per minute (bpm).<br><br>Explain that a normal resting pulse for kids is around 70–100 bpm.<br>Discuss how this changes during exercise or rest.<br><br>Activity:<br>Pair up students to practice measuring each other's pulse.<br>Encourage them to record the resting pulse rate in their notebooks.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of the Pulse</b>:<br><br>Explain why knowing how to take your pulse is important:<br>- It helps monitor your health.<br>- It can show how your body reacts to exercise.<br>- Doctors use it to check heart health.<br><br>Mention that exercise makes the pulse faster temporarily, but regular exercise helps the heart stay strong over time.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise Activity (Practical Application)</b>:<br><br>Have the class do a light exercise, such as jogging in place, jumping jacks, or dancing for 2-3 minutes.<br>Immediately after the exercise, ask students to measure their pulse again.<br><br>Compare their resting pulse with their pulse after exercise.<br>Lead a class discussion:<br>'What happened to your pulse after exercising? Why do you think it increased?'<br><br>Wrap-Up:<br>- Recap the steps for locating and measuring the pulse.<br>- Highlight the importance of keeping the heart healthy through exercise and good habits.<br><br>Task/Homework:<br>Ask students to practice taking their pulse at home and record their pulse rate before and after a physical activity.

      "<b>Part 3: Emotional and Social Changes</b>:<br><br>Puberty can bring changes in emotions, moods, and feelings. Girls might experience emotional ups and downs, and they may become more sensitive or frustrated at times. There is also a greater desire for independence, and girls may start to want more privacy and time alone. These changes are normal and part of growing up. Hormones play a big role in how we feel. It’s important to talk to trusted adults (like parents, teachers, or school counselors) when they feel confused or upset.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Use an emotion chart or mood tracker to show how emotions can change from day to day or week to week.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of Personal Care and Hygiene</b>:<br><br>During puberty, girls may experience more sweating and body odor due to the increased activity of sweat glands. It’s important to take regular showers, use deodorant, and wear clean clothes. Girls will also need to use sanitary products (like pads or tampons) during their period to maintain cleanliness. Proper skincare, like washing the face to prevent acne, is important during this time.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Show examples of personal care products (deodorant, soap, sanitary pads) and explain how to use them.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to STIs and HIV</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Begin by explaining what STIs and HIV are.<br><br>STIs: These are infections that can be passed from one person to another through sexual contact.<br>HIV: This is a virus that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) if not treated. HIV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.<br><br>Ask students to raise their hands if they have heard about HIV and STIs before, and briefly discuss any information they may already know.",
      "<b>Part 2: Ways of Transmission</b>:<br><br>Explanation of Transmission Methods:<br><br>Unprotected Sexual Activity: HIV and many STIs can be spread through sexual activities such as vaginal, anal, or oral sex if a person does not use protection (such as condoms). Protection helps to reduce the risk of transmission.<br><br>Contaminated Blood: HIV and some STIs can also be transmitted through blood if an infected person's blood enters another person’s bloodstream. This can happen when people share needles, for example, during drug use or in medical procedures without proper sterilization.<br><br>Breast Milk: HIV can be passed from a mother to her child during breastfeeding. It’s important to be aware that HIV is present in breast milk, and children who drink infected milk may contract the virus.<br><br>Sharp Instruments: Sharp instruments such as needles, razors, or tattoo equipment that are not properly sterilized can transfer infected blood. If one person has HIV or another STI and uses these items, it can infect others who use the same instruments.",
      "<b>Part 3: Prevention of Transmission</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Explain that while STIs and HIV are serious health concerns, there are ways to prevent them:<br><br>Use of Protection: Using condoms during sexual activity can greatly reduce the risk of transmission.<br><br>Avoid Sharing Needles: Never share needles, razors, or any sharp objects with others.<br><br>Medical Advice and Screening: Regular medical check-ups and testing for STIs and HIV can help catch infections early and prevent further spread.<br><br>Safe Breastfeeding: Mothers who are HIV-positive should seek medical advice on how to reduce the risk of passing HIV to their children during breastfeeding.",
      "<b>Part 4: Understanding the Importance of Education</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Emphasize the importance of learning about STIs and HIV to prevent them. Encourage students to:<br><br>Speak up about these issues with their parents or guardians.<br><br>Educate themselves on healthy behaviors, like practicing safe sex in the future and understanding the risks associated with certain actions.<br><br>Recognize the significance of hygiene, such as not sharing personal items like razors and toothbrushes.<br><br>It’s important for students to know that understanding these topics helps to protect their health and the health of others.",

Emphasize that water is essential for plant survival. Discuss how water helps retain nutrients and is necessary for various plant processes.<br><br>Discussion Questions:<br>What do you think happens when soil doesn't have enough water?<br>How do plants use water?",
      "<b>Part 2: Water and Seed Germination</b>:<br><br>Explain that seed germination is the process by which a seed begins to grow into a new plant. Water activates enzymes in the seed, breaking down stored food for energy. Without water, seeds cannot sprout.<br><br>Key Points:<br>Water softens the seed coat, dissolves nutrients from the soil, and helps the seed take in oxygen. Show an illustration or video of seed germination to reinforce these concepts.",
      "<b>Part 3: Water and Photosynthesis</b>:<br><br>Explain photosynthesis as the process by which plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food. Water travels through the plant to the leaves, where it combines with carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight to create glucose.<br><br>Key Points:<br>Water is necessary for photosynthesis. Without water, plants cannot produce food and will not grow. Use a simple diagram to demonstrate the process of photosynthesis.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Role of Water in Soil and Plant Growth</b>:<br><br>Discuss how water in the soil is crucial not only for seed germination and photosynthesis but also for overall plant health. The balance of water and air in the soil is necessary for roots to absorb nutrients. Without water, plants cannot effectively transport nutrients, which leads to plant death.<br><br>Key Points:<br>Water in soil helps keep plants hydrated and nourished. Proper soil moisture is essential for healthy plant growth.",
