Carrying Oxygen and Nutrients: Blood carries oxygen from the lungs and nutrients from the food we eat to all the body parts.<br>3. Removing Waste: The blood also carries waste, like carbon dioxide, away from the body to be removed.<br>4.

      "<b>Part 3: The Valves</b>:<br><br>Between each chamber are valves that act like doors, preventing blood from flowing backward.<br>Example: The tricuspid valve is between the right atrium and right ventricle.<br><br>Demonstrate how valves work using a simple analogy like a one-way door or draw it on the board.",

What do you think that feeling is?'<br><br>Explain that the pulse is the rhythmic beating of the arteries as blood is pumped by the heart.<br><br>Share a simple definition: 'Your pulse is a sign of how fast or slow your heart is beating. It tells us how hard our heart is working.'<br><br>Key Points to Cover:<br>- The pulse can be felt where arteries are close to the skin, such as the wrist or neck.<br>- The heart beats faster during exercise to supply more oxygen and nutrients to the body.",
      "<b>Part 2: Locating the Pulse</b>:<br><br>Demonstrate how to find the pulse:<br><br>Wrist (Radial Pulse):<br>- Hold up your left hand.<br>- With the index and middle fingers of your right hand, gently press on the thumb side of your wrist below the base of the thumb.<br><br>Neck (Carotid Pulse):<br>- Place your index and middle fingers on either side of your throat, below the jawline.<br>- Press gently until you feel a steady beat.<br><br>Activity:<br>Have students try to locate their pulse on their wrist and neck.<br>Walk around the room to assist students who might struggle to find it.",
      "<b>Part 3: Measuring the Pulse</b>:<br><br>Demonstrate how to measure the pulse:<br>- Once the students locate their pulse, ask them to count the number of beats they feel in 15 seconds.<br>- Multiply this number by 4 to get the pulse rate in beats per minute (bpm).<br><br>Explain that a normal resting pulse for kids is around 70–100 bpm.<br>Discuss how this changes during exercise or rest.<br><br>Activity:<br>Pair up students to practice measuring each other's pulse.<br>Encourage them to record the resting pulse rate in their notebooks.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of the Pulse</b>:<br><br>Explain why knowing how to take your pulse is important:<br>- It helps monitor your health.<br>- It can show how your body reacts to exercise.<br>- Doctors use it to check heart health.<br><br>Mention that exercise makes the pulse faster temporarily, but regular exercise helps the heart stay strong over time.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise Activity (Practical Application)</b>:<br><br>Have the class do a light exercise, such as jogging in place, jumping jacks, or dancing for 2-3 minutes.<br>Immediately after the exercise, ask students to measure their pulse again.<br><br>Compare their resting pulse with their pulse after exercise.<br>Lead a class discussion:<br>'What happened to your pulse after exercising? Why do you think it increased?'<br><br>Wrap-Up:<br>- Recap the steps for locating and measuring the pulse.<br>- Highlight the importance of keeping the heart healthy through exercise and good habits.<br><br>Task/Homework:<br>Ask students to practice taking their pulse at home and record their pulse rate before and after a physical activity. They should bring their results to the next lesson."

This usually happens between ages 9 and 14 in boys. Discuss how everyone experiences puberty, but the timing and symptoms may vary.<br><br>Key Points:<br>Puberty is a natural process of growth and development.<br>It marks the time when boys begin to develop the ability to reproduce.",
      "<b>Part 2: Physical Changes in Boys</b>:<br><br>Objective: To explain the physical changes that occur in boys during puberty.<br><br>Discussion: Boys undergo several noticeable physical changes during puberty. Discuss the following:<br><br>1. Growth Spurts: Boys experience rapid growth in height and muscle mass.<br>2. Voice Deepening: The voice box grows, causing the voice to deepen and become more like an adult's.<br>3. Facial and Body Hair: Hair begins to grow on the face (mustache, beard) and other parts of the body, such as underarms and the chest.<br>4. Skin Changes: Increased oil production may cause acne (pimples) on the face and back.<br>5.

Showering Regularly: Because of increased sweat and oil production, regular bathing helps keep the body clean and free of body odor.<br>2. Face Washing: Washing the face helps manage acne and keeps skin healthy.<br>3. Wearing Clean Clothes: Wearing clean clothes helps to prevent body odor.<br>4. Shaving and Grooming: Boys may choose to shave or trim facial hair, and grooming is a personal choice that should be done safely.",

True or False Questions: (Give each student a piece of paper or use a whiteboard)<br>Puberty occurs at the same age for everyone. (False)<br>Boys may notice physical changes like growing taller and developing hair. (True)<br>Boys don't need to worry about hygiene during puberty.

Girls experience puberty earlier than boys, and it is important for them to understand these changes to be prepared for what happens as they grow.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Show a diagram or video that illustrates the physical changes that happen in girls during puberty, such as growth spurts, breast development, and hair growth.",

Breast Development: One of the first visible signs of puberty in girls is the growth of breasts. They may begin to feel tender or sore during this time. Body Hair: Hair begins to grow in new areas, including under the arms and in the pubic region. Menstruation: Girls will start their periods, which is a sign that their body is capable of reproduction. This can happen anywhere from ages 9 to 16. Skin Changes: Hormones during puberty can lead to acne and oily skin, which is very common.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Provide an age-appropriate chart showing the stages of puberty in girls, highlighting these changes.",
      "<b>Part 3: Emotional and Social Changes</b>:<br><br>Puberty can bring changes in emotions, moods, and feelings. Girls might experience emotional ups and downs, and they may become more sensitive or frustrated at times. There is also a greater desire for independence, and girls may start to want more privacy and time alone. These changes are normal and part of growing up. Hormones play a big role in how we feel. It’s important to talk to trusted adults (like parents, teachers, or school counselors) when they feel confused or upset.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Use an emotion chart or mood tracker to show how emotions can change from day to day or week to week.",
      "<b>Part 4: Importance of Personal Care and Hygiene</b>:<br><br>During puberty, girls may experience more sweating and body odor due to the increased activity of sweat glands. It’s important to take regular showers, use deodorant, and wear clean clothes. Girls will also need to use sanitary products (like pads or tampons) during their period to maintain cleanliness. Proper skincare, like washing the face to prevent acne, is important during this time.<br><br>Visual Aid:<br>Show examples of personal care products (deodorant, soap, sanitary pads) and explain how to use them.",

It helps maintain good air quality and provides a comfortable environment.<br><br><b>Types of Ventilation:</b><br>1. <b>Natural Ventilation</b> – Air flows through open windows, doors, and vents.<br>2. <b>Mechanical Ventilation</b> – Uses fans, air conditioners, or ventilation systems to circulate air.<br><br><b>Discussion Questions:</b><br>Where do you see ventilation in your home or classroom?<br>What happens if there are no windows or fans in a room?",
      "<b>Part 2: Why is Good Ventilation Important?</b>:<br><br>1. <b>Improves Air Quality</b><br>Removes dust, smoke, and other pollutants from the air.<br>Helps reduce allergies and respiratory problems.<br><br>2. <b>Prevents the Spread of Diseases</b><br>Fresh air reduces the concentration of germs and bacteria.<br>Helps prevent illnesses like colds, flu, and COVID-19.<br><br>3. <b>Reduces Unpleasant Odors</b><br>Removes bad smells from cooking, waste, or chemicals.<br>Keeps the environment fresh and comfortable.<br><br>4. <b>Controls Temperature and Humidity</b><br>Prevents rooms from becoming too hot or too cold.<br>Reduces dampness and prevents mold growth.<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Ask students to close the windows and observe how they feel. Then, open the windows and discuss the difference.",
