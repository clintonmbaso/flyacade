Explain:<br>A forest is a large area filled with many trees and plants. It is home to many animals and provides many useful things for people.",
      "<b>Part 2: Explanation – Importance to People</b>:<br><br>Tell learners that forests help people in many ways:<br><br>1. Wood:<br>We get timber from trees in forests. Wood is used to build houses, make furniture, pencils, and paper.<br><br>2. Shelter:<br>Some people live near or in forests and use materials from trees to build their homes.<br><br>3.

Home for Animals:<br>Animals such as monkeys, birds, snakes, and insects live in forests. They find food and shelter there.<br><br>2. Rainfall:<br>Trees help bring rain. Forests keep the air moist and cool, which helps form clouds and rain.<br><br>3. Preventing Soil Erosion:<br>Tree roots hold the soil together so that it does not get washed away by rain or blown away by wind.",

      "<b>Part 2: Explanation – What People Do to Forests</b>:<br><br>Tell learners some ways humans harm forests:<br><br>1. Cutting Down Trees (Deforestation):<br>People cut down trees for timber, farming, or to build homes. This is called deforestation.<br><br>2. Burning Trees:<br>Some people burn trees to clear land for farming, which destroys the forest.<br><br>3. Building Roads and Houses:<br>When we build in forest areas, we remove trees and destroy animal homes.",

Soil Erosion:<br>Without trees, soil is easily washed away by rain or blown by wind.<br><br>2. Loss of Animal Habitats:<br>Animals lose their homes and food sources when trees are destroyed.<br><br>3. Droughts:<br>Fewer trees mean less rainfall, which can lead to droughts (very dry conditions).<br><br>4. Climate Change:<br>Cutting down too many trees can change the weather and make the earth hotter.",
