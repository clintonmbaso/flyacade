      "<b>Part 1: Introduction – What is Water in the Soil?</b><br><br>Water in the soil is the moisture that comes from rain, irrigation, or underground water. Plants absorb this water through their roots. This water is essential for plant growth, health, and survival.<br><br>Why is it important?<br><br>Plants, like all living things, need water to survive.<br><br>Water helps carry nutrients from the soil to the plant.<br><br>Without water in the soil, plants cannot grow properly.",
      "<b>Part 2: Water and Seed Germination</b><br><br>Seed germination is the process where a seed begins to grow into a plant.<br><br>How water helps:<br><br>When a seed is planted, it needs water to soften its coat.<br><br>Water activates enzymes that start the growth process.<br><br>Without enough water, seeds will not sprout.<br><br>Example: If you plant two seeds and only water one, the one with water will sprout, while the dry one may not.",
      "<b>Part 3: Water and Photosynthesis</b><br><br>Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.<br><br>How water helps:<br><br>Water is one of the main ingredients in photosynthesis.<br><br>Without water, the plant cannot make food.<br><br>If a plant cannot make food, it becomes weak and may die.<br><br>Simple Equation of Photosynthesis: Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Food (Glucose) + Oxygen",
      "<b>Part 4: Other Roles of Water in the Soil</b><br><br>Helps in nutrient absorption: Water helps dissolve nutrients in the soil, making it easier for plant roots to absorb them.<br><br>Keeps plants cool: Water evaporates from the leaves to cool the plant, a process called transpiration.<br><br>Supports life: Soil organisms like worms and insects need moist soil to live.",

[
"<b>Part 1: Introduction – What Does It Mean to Retain Water in the Soil?</b><br><br>To retain water means to keep or hold water in the soil for a longer time. This is important because:<br><br>Plants need water to grow.<br><br>If water quickly runs off or dries up, plants may not get enough.<br><br>Keeping water in the soil helps during dry times.",
"<b>Part 2: Method 1 – Mulching and Shading</b><br><br>1. Mulching<br><br>Mulching is when we cover the soil with dry grass, leaves, straw, or plastic.<br><br>It prevents sunlight from drying the soil too quickly.<br><br>It also protects the soil from being washed away by rain.<br><br>2. Shading<br><br>Growing taller plants or using shade nets helps block direct sunlight.<br><br>This keeps the soil cooler and reduces water loss through evaporation.",
"<b>Part 3: Method 2 – Terracing and Weeding</b><br><br>3. Terracing<br><br>This involves cutting flat steps into hills or slopes.<br><br>It slows down water that runs down and allows it to soak into the soil.<br><br>It prevents soil erosion and helps the soil hold water longer.<br><br>4. Weeding<br><br>Weeds compete with crops for water.<br><br>Removing weeds ensures more water stays in the soil for the main plants.<br><br>Clean soil also reduces water loss.",
"<b>Part 4: Method 3 – Intercropping</b><br><br>5. Intercropping<br><br>Intercropping means planting two or more different crops together.<br><br>Different plants can cover more ground and protect the soil.<br><br>This reduces evaporation and keeps the soil moist.<br><br>Example: Growing maize with beans — maize provides shade, and beans help cover the ground.",
"<b>Part 5: Exercise – Test Your Understanding</b><br><br><u>A. Match the methods with their descriptions:</u><br><br>1. Mulching – _____<br>2. Terracing – _____<br>3. Weeding – _____<br>4.

      "<b>Part 2: Types of Soil and Their Drainage</b><br><br>There are three main types of soil with different drainage abilities:<br><br>1.

Clay Soil<br>Made of very small, sticky particles.<br>Water drains very slowly.<br>Feels smooth and sticky when wet.<br><br>3.
