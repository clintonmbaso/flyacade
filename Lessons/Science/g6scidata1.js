      "<b>Part 3: Pulmonary Circulation</b>:<br><br>Pulmonary circulation carries oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation and back to the heart.<br><br>Explanation:<br>In this process, blood picks up oxygen in the lungs and releases carbon dioxide.",
      "<b>Part 4: Systemic Circulation</b>:<br><br>Systemic circulation distributes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all body parts and returns oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.<br><br>Explanation:<br>This process delivers oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues and collects waste products.",
