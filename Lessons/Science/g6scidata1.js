      "<b>Part 3: Pulmonary Circulation</b>:<br><br>Pulmonary circulation carries oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation and back to the heart.<br><br>Explanation:<br>In this process, blood picks up oxygen in the lungs and releases carbon dioxide.",

Why does this change become more noticeable in the second trimester?",
      "<b>Part 2: Enlargement of Breasts</b>:<br><br>The breasts increase in size during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, particularly the increased levels of estrogen and progesterone. These hormones prepare the body for breastfeeding by enlarging milk-producing glands and increasing blood flow to the breasts.<br><br>Discussion:<br>What are some reasons the body might prepare the breasts for feeding during pregnancy? How do hormones play a role in these changes?",
      "<b>Part 3: Hormonal and Physical Changes</b>:<br><br>Pregnancy involves significant hormonal changes, including higher levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and estrogen. These changes may lead to symptoms such as nausea (morning sickness), fatigue, mood swings, and skin changes, like the appearance of stretch marks or darkened areas (linea nigra) on the skin.<br><br>Discussion:<br>What are some of the symptoms caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy? How do you think these changes help support the growing baby?",
      "<b>Part 4: Emotional and Psychological Changes</b>:<br><br>Pregnancy can bring about various emotional changes, ranging from excitement and joy to anxiety and mood swings. These feelings are influenced by hormonal fluctuations and the anticipation of the responsibilities of parenthood.<br><br>Discussion:<br>How do you think emotions might change during pregnancy? Why do you think these emotional changes happen?",
