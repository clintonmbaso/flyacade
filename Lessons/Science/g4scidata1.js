Explain the importance of ears: Discuss how ears help us hear sounds, detect danger, and maintain balance.<br>3. Show a diagram of the ear: Display a labeled diagram of the ear on the board or screen. Briefly point out the three main sections: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.",
      "<b>Part 2: Outer Ear</b>:<br><br>1. Explanation: The outer ear includes the visible part (pinna) and the ear canal. It collects sound waves and directs them to the eardrum.<br>2. Activity: Ask students to touch their outer ears and identify its shape. Explain how the unique shape of the ear helps to funnel sound into the ear canal.",
      "<b>Part 3: Middle Ear</b>:<br><br>1. Explanation: The middle ear contains the eardrum and three small bones: the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. Sound waves cause the eardrum to vibrate, which is then passed to the three small bones. These bones amplify the sound vibrations.<br>2. Demonstration: Use a drum or thin material to show how vibrations occur when sound hits it.",
      "<b>Part 4: Inner Ear</b>:<br><br>1. Explanation: The inner ear includes the cochlea (a spiral-shaped structure) and the auditory nerve. The cochlea converts sound vibrations into signals that the brain can understand. The inner ear also helps with balance through the semicircular canals.<br>2. Illustration: Show an animation or diagram of how the cochlea works and connects to the brain via the auditory nerve.",

Ask them to label the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear, along with key parts like the pinna, eardrum, cochlea, and auditory nerve.<br>2. Matching Game: Create a worksheet with descriptions of ear parts (e.g., 'Amplifies sound vibrations' for middle ear) and ask students to match the descriptions to the correct part.<br>3.
