It can be found in numbers, shapes, colors, and many other places in life.<br><br>Discuss why patterns are important (they help us predict and understand things around us). For example, recognizing a pattern in numbers helps us solve problems more easily.",

Guide them to look for the rule (increasing by a set number, alternating shapes, repeating colors, etc.).",

They can document and explain the patterns they find:<br>Example 1: A leaf’s veins or the pattern in a sunflower.<br>Example 2: The repetitive patterns in animal fur or scales.<br>Example 3: The way tree branches spread out or the structure of honeycombs in a beehive.<br><br>After the activity, have students present their drawings and observations to the class, discussing the function and significance of the patterns they’ve chosen."

Addition: Start with a number and add the same value to each term.<br>Example: 5, 10, 15, __, __ (Pattern: Add 5)<br><br>2. Subtraction: Start with a number and subtract the same value from each term.<br>Example: 20, 15, 10, __, __ (Pattern: Subtract 5)<br><br>3. Multiplication: Multiply each term by the same value.<br>Example: 3, 6, 9, __, __ (Pattern: Multiply by 3)<br><br>Ask students to create their own number patterns and share them with a partner or the class.

Repeating Shapes: Use a set of shapes that repeat in a specific order.<br>Example: Triangle, Square, Triangle, Square, __ (Pattern: Alternate between triangle and square)<br><br>2. Increasing Shapes: Use shapes that increase or decrease in complexity.<br>Example: Triangle, Square, Pentagon, __, __ (Pattern: Add one side to each shape)<br><br>Have students create their own shape patterns.
