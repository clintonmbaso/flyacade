      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Action Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Learners will understand what an action verb is and how it functions in a sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>An action verb is a word that shows what someone or something does. It tells us about an action. It could be a physical action (like jump, run, throw) or a mental action (like think, dream, believe).<br><br>Examples:<br><br>The dog barks.<br>Sarah writes stories.<br>They play football.<br><br>Activity:<br>Let learners act out different action verbs you say (e.g., jump, run, clap, dance, think).",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Direct Objects</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Learners will understand what a direct object is and its role in a sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>A direct object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb. It answers the questions “what?” or “whom?” after the verb.<br><br>Examples:<br>He kicked the ball. (What did he kick? The ball)<br>She saw her friend. (Whom did she see? Her friend)<br><br>Important Tip:<br>The sentence must have an action verb to have a direct object.",

The cat chased the mouse.<br>Action verb: chased<br>Direct object: the mouse<br><br>2. James ate the apple.<br>Action verb: ate<br>Direct object: the apple<br><br>3. She painted a picture.<br>Action verb: painted<br>Direct object: a picture<br><br>Activity:<br>Write a few sentences on the board and let learners underline the action verb and circle the direct object.",
      "<b>Part 4: Creating Sentences</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Learners will practice writing their own sentences using action verbs and direct objects.<br><br>Instructions:<br>Ask learners to come up with 3 of their own sentences. Each sentence must include:<br>A clear action verb<br>A direct object<br><br>Example for Learners:<br>I washed the dishes.<br>The teacher marked the books.<br>We watched a movie.<br><br>Encourage creativity and clarity in writing.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br><br>A. Underline the action verb and circle the direct object in each sentence below.<br>1. The girl played the guitar.<br>2. Dad fixed the car.<br>3. We climbed the mountain.<br>4. They opened the door.<br>5. She drew a picture.<br><br>B.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Subject-Verb Agreement</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will understand the importance of subject-verb agreement in a sentence.<br><br>Explanation: In English, a verb must agree with its subject in terms of number (singular or plural). This means that if the subject is singular, the verb will often end in -s. If the subject is plural (or if it is I or you), the verb does not take an -s.<br><br>Example Sentences:<br>She plays the piano. (singular subject, adds -s to the verb)<br>They play the piano. (plural subject, no -s added to the verb)<br>I eat breakfast every morning. (I, no -s added)<br>You work hard. (you, no -s added)",
      "<b>Part 2: Rules for Adding -s to Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will learn when to add -s to a verb in the present tense.<br><br>Explanation & Examples:<br>1. Singular subjects: When the subject of a sentence is singular (one person, thing, or idea), the verb often gets -s at the end.<br>She runs fast. (singular subject, adds -s)<br>John reads books. (singular subject, adds -s)<br><br>2. Plural subjects: When the subject is plural (more than one person, thing, or idea), the verb does not get -s.<br>They run fast. (plural subject, no -s)<br>The children read books. (plural subject, no -s)<br><br>3. I and you: The verb never takes -s with I or you.<br>I eat pizza. (I, no -s added)<br>You work every day. (you, no -s added)",
      "<b>Part 3: Practice Identifying Subject-Verb Agreement</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will practice identifying whether the subject and verb agree in number.<br><br>Explanation & Examples:<br>Look at the following sentences. Identify if the verb agrees with the subject.<br><br>1. The dog barks loudly.<br>Subject: dog (singular)<br>Verb: barks (correct, adds -s for singular subject)<br><br>2. The dogs bark loudly.<br>Subject: dogs (plural)<br>Verb: bark (correct, no -s for plural subject)<br><br>3. She eat ice cream.<br>Subject: She (singular)<br>Verb: eat (incorrect, should be eats)<br><br>4. We runs every morning.<br>Subject: We (plural)<br>Verb: runs (incorrect, should be run)",
      "<b>Part 4: Correcting Subject-Verb Agreement Errors</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learners will practice correcting subject-verb agreement errors in sentences.<br><br>Instructions: Below are sentences with subject-verb agreement errors. Have the learners correct them.<br><br>1. He play football.<br>Correct form: He plays football.<br><br>2. They loves animals.<br>Correct form: They love animals.<br><br>3. The teacher give us homework.<br>Correct form: The teacher gives us homework.<br><br>4. We enjoy the party.<br>Correct form: We enjoy the party. (This sentence is correct as is!)<br><br>5. I goes to school by bus.<br>Correct form: I go to school by bus.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: A. Choose the correct verb form for each sentence.<br><br>1. She __________ (play/plays) the guitar.<br>2. The students __________ (study/studies) for the test.<br>3. I __________ (like/likes) chocolate ice cream.<br>4. We __________ (eat/eats) lunch at noon.<br>5. He __________ (watch/watches) TV in the evening.<br><br>B. Rewrite the sentences below correctly.<br><br>1. She walk to school every day.<br>2. The dogs plays in the park.<br>3. You works hard every day.<br>4. I loves reading books.<br>5. They goes to the market."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Present Tense</b>:<br><br>A verb in the present tense tells us what happens now. Present tense verbs describe actions or states that are happening in the current time. For example:<br><br>She eats breakfast every morning.<br>I play with my friends after school.<br><br>Present tense verbs can describe things that happen regularly or actions that are happening right now.",
      "<b>Part 2: Subject-Verb Agreement in Present Tense</b>:<br><br>In English, subject-verb agreement means that the subject and the verb must match in number (singular or plural). This is very important when using the present tense.<br><br>For singular subjects (one person or thing), we add -s to most verbs.<br>Example: She plays the piano.<br>The dog runs fast.<br><br>For plural subjects (more than one person or thing), we do not add -s to the verb.<br>Example: They play the piano.<br>The dogs run fast.<br><br>For the pronouns 'I' and 'you', we do not add -s to the verb, even though 'I' is singular.<br>Example: I eat lunch at noon.<br>You work hard every day.",

      "<b>Part 1: What is a Direct Quotation?</b>:<br><br>A direct quotation is when we repeat the exact words spoken by someone. We use quotation marks (' ') to show that these are the exact words of the speaker. For example: John said, 'I love reading books.' Notice that the words 'I love reading books' are the exact words spoken by John, so they are placed inside quotation marks.",
      "<b>Part 2: Using Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>We use quotation marks before and after the words of a direct quotation. Here’s how it looks: 'I can’t wait for the weekend!' said Sarah. Quotation Marks: “ ” Before the words: We put the opening quotation mark before the words. After the words: We put the closing quotation mark after the words.",
      "<b>Part 3: Comma Before a Quotation (Speaker First)</b>:<br><br>When the speaker’s name comes first, we use a comma before the quotation. This tells the reader that the speaker is about to say something. For example: Sarah said, \"I love playing outside.\" Tom asked, \"Are we going to the park?\" Notice the comma before the quotation marks when the speaker's name comes first.",
      "<b>Part 4: Punctuation After the Quotation (Speaker Last)</b>:<br><br>When the speaker’s name comes last, we need to use a comma, question mark, or exclamation point to end the quotation. This punctuation mark goes inside the quotation marks. Examples: \"I can’t wait to see the movie,\" said Lisa. \"Are you ready for the test?\" asked Mr. Lee. \"What a beautiful day!\" shouted James. Comma: Used when the quotation ends with a statement. Question Mark: Used when the quotation is a question. Exclamation Point: Used when the quotation expresses excitement or surprise.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>Now, let’s practice! Choose the correct punctuation for each sentence:<br>1. \"I’m going to the store,\" ________ Sarah.<br>2. \"What time does the movie start?\" ________ Mark.<br>3. \"Wow, look at that rainbow!\" ________ Anna.<br>4. ________ Peter said, \"I’m going to visit my grandma tomorrow.\"<br>5. \"Can I borrow your pencil?\" ________ Maria.<br>6. ________ James shouted, \"We won the game!\"<br>7. \"I’ll meet you at the park,\" ________ Emily.<br>8. ________ Mike asked, \"What’s for lunch?\"<br>9. \"I love playing soccer,\" ________ Ben.<br>10. \"Let’s go swimming,\" ________ Lily."

It links \"She\" to \"a teacher.\"\n\nExplain the purpose:\n\nIt tells us more about the subject. What is the subject? What does it look like, feel like, or become?",
      "Part 2: Common Linking Verbs\n\nShare a list of common linking verbs:\n\nam, is, are, was, were\n\nbe, being, been\n\nseem, feel, appear, become, look, taste, smell\n\nExamples:\n\nHe was tired. (Was links \"he\" to the adjective \"tired\")\n\nThe soup tastes nice. (Tastes links \"soup\" to \"nice\")\n\nThey are happy. (Are links \"they\" to \"happy\")\n\nNote:\n\nSome of these verbs can also be action verbs depending on how they are used. For now, focus on their use as linking verbs.",
      "Part 3: How to Identify a Linking Verb\n\nTo recognize a linking verb:\n\n1. Find the verb in the sentence.\n\n2. Ask: Is the verb showing action?\nIf yes, it's an action verb.\nIf no, and it's connecting the subject to a description or identity, it's a linking verb.\n\n3. Check: Can you replace the verb with is/are and the sentence still makes sense?\nIf yes, it's likely a linking verb.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe cake smells good. (Linking — no action, describes the cake)\n\nThe dog smelled the bone. (Action — the dog is doing something)",
      "Part 4: Linking Verbs vs Action Verbs\n\nLet’s compare:\n\nLinking Verb:\n\nShe felt cold. (Describes how she feels — no action)\n\nAction Verb:\n\nShe felt the fabric. (She is touching it — action)\n\nActivity:\n\nAsk learners to give their own examples.\n\nGuide them to say whether the verb is linking or action.",
      "Part 5: Exercises\n\nA. Underline the linking verbs in the sentences below:\n1. The children are excited about the trip.\n2. This soup tastes delicious.\n3. My brother is a doctor.\n4. The sky looks dark.\n5. She seems tired today.\n\nB. Rewrite the sentences, replacing the linking verb with another linking verb:\n1. The boy is happy.\n2. The food smells great.\n3. They were angry.\n4. I am hungry.\n5. The baby looks sleepy.\n\nC. Write your own 3 sentences using a linking verb. Underline the linking verb."

An irregular verb is a verb that does not follow the regular rule of adding -ed to form its past tense. Regular verbs, like 'talk' or 'play,' simply add '-ed' to the base form to create the past tense. However, irregular verbs change completely and do not follow a set pattern. For example: Regular verb: talk → talked. Irregular verb: think → thought. In this lesson, we'll focus on recognizing common irregular verbs and understanding their past tense forms.",

      "<b>Part 3: Rules of Irregular Verbs</b>:<br><br>While there is no one-size-fits-all rule for irregular verbs, there are some patterns you can watch for: Some verbs change vowels: Example: drink → drank, speak → spoke. Some verbs have completely different past tense forms: Example: go → went, be → was/were. Some verbs keep the same form for both present and past tense: Example: put (present) → put (past). Understanding these patterns can help in recognizing and using irregular verbs correctly.",
      "<b>Part 4: Using Irregular Verbs in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Now that we've seen examples, let's practice using irregular verbs in sentences. Here are a few examples: Yesterday, I thought about my homework. She wore a beautiful dress to the party last night. They caught the ball during the game. He tore his paper by accident. We spoke to the teacher about our project. In these examples, notice how the past tense form of each irregular verb is used in context.

They speak the dialogue and act out the events.<br><br>Setting: The time and place where the story occurs.<br><br>Stage Directions: Instructions for the actors and crew about how to move or behave on stage.<br><br>Dialogue: The spoken words of the characters.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What do you think makes a play different from other types of stories? How do you think the components of a play help bring the story to life?",
      "<b>Part 2: Components of a Play</b>:<br><br>Let’s break down the components of a play in more detail:<br><br>Setting: The setting tells us where and when the story is taking place. It is often shown in italic print in the script to make it clear to the actors and audience where the scene is set.<br>Example: The scene takes place in a small park during the afternoon.<br><br>Characters: The characters are the main figures in the play. Each character's name is listed and indented at the beginning of their lines, followed by a colon. This tells the actor who is speaking.<br>Example: John: I can't believe it's already afternoon!<br><br>Stage Directions: Stage directions provide instructions on how the actors should move, speak, or express emotions during the scene. These directions are written in italics and are placed in parentheses. They are not spoken aloud but are meant to guide the actors' actions.<br>Example: John (excitedly): I can't believe it's already afternoon! (John jumps up and runs to the door.)<br><br>Dialogue: The dialogue is the spoken words of the characters. In a script, the dialogue is written after the character's name, and quotation marks are not used.<br>Example: John: I can't believe it's already afternoon!",
      "<b>Part 3: Format of a Play</b>:<br><br>Let’s take a closer look at how the play's script is formatted:<br><br>The characters' names are written first and followed by a colon.<br>The stage directions are written in italics and parentheses, right after the character’s name, to explain any actions or emotions.<br>The dialogue is written directly after the character's name and is not enclosed in quotation marks.<br><br>Here’s an example of how a scene in a play might look:<br><br>Setting: A small park in the afternoon.<br>John (looking around): It’s such a beautiful day! (John sits down on the bench and smiles.)<br>Jane (entering from stage left): Hi, John! What are you doing here? (Jane waves as she walks towards John.)<br>John: I’m just enjoying the sunshine. How about you? Jane: I came for a walk. It’s too nice to stay inside.",
      "<b>Part 4: Understanding and Identifying Play Components</b>:<br><br>Now let’s practice identifying the different components in a short play excerpt:<br><br>Setting: A school classroom, early morning.<br>Mark (rushing to his seat): Oh no, I’m late for class! (Mark quickly grabs his books and sits down.)<br>Teacher (sternly): Mark, you’re late again.<br>Mark: I’m sorry, Teacher. I missed the bus.<br>Teacher: This is the third time this week. Please be on time tomorrow.<br><br>In this example:<br><br>Setting: A school classroom, early morning<br>Characters: Mark, Teacher<br>Stage Directions: (rushing to his seat), (Mark quickly grabs his books and sits down), (sternly)<br>Dialogue: The words spoken by Mark and Teacher.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read the following short play excerpt and identify the setting, characters, stage directions, and dialogue.<br><br>Setting: A kitchen at night.<br>Tom (holding a bowl of popcorn): Want some popcorn? (Tom sits down on the couch and turns on the TV.)<br>Sarah (shaking her head): No, thanks. I’m too full.<br>Tom: Come on, just a little bit. It’s the best part of the movie!<br><br>Questions:<br>1. What is the setting of this play?<br>2. Who are the characters in this play?<br>3. Identify one stage direction in the play.<br>4. Write out the dialogue spoken by Tom.<br><br>Answers:<br>1. Setting: A kitchen at night.<br>2. Characters: Tom, Sarah<br>3. Stage Direction: (holding a bowl of popcorn), (Tom sits down on the couch and turns on the TV), (shaking her head)<br>4. Dialogue (spoken by Tom): Want some popcorn?, Come on, just a little bit. It’s the best part of the movie!"

This is especially true in playwriting, where proper punctuation and correct verb forms help the actors understand how to perform the lines.<br><br>In dialogue, we must make sure to:<br>Correctly punctuate dialogue: Dialogue should have punctuation marks like commas, periods, and question marks, depending on what is being said.<br>Use correct verb forms: Ensure that verbs are in the correct tense and form. For example, \"standed\" should be \"stood,\" and \"sayed\" should be \"said.\"",
      "<b>Part 2: Review of the Dialogue</b>:<br><br>Let's take a look at the scene provided. We'll first identify the mistakes in punctuation and verb forms.<br><br>Scene 1:<br><br>LaWonda on stage at rehearsal.

      "<b>Part 3: Identifying the Mistakes</b>:<br><br>1. \"Standed\": The correct form of this verb is \"stood\" (simple past tense).<br>2. \"Supposing\": The correct form here should be \"supposed\" (past participle).<br>3. \"Making\": The correct form should be \"makes\" (present tense, third-person singular).<br>4. \"Sayed\": The correct form is \"said\" (past tense).<br>5. \"Belonged\": The correct form should be \"belong\" (present tense). In this context, it should be a present tense verb, as Sarah is referring to Danny's current position in the scene.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Pronouns (What is a Pronoun?)</b>:<br><br>A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun. Instead of repeating the same noun over and over, we use pronouns to make sentences sound more natural and less repetitive. Common pronouns include: I, You, He, She, It, We, They.<br><br>For example: 'Tom likes to read books. He reads every day.' In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' replaces the noun Tom.<br><br>Discussion: Ask students to think of their favorite pronouns and use them in sentences.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Role of Antecedents (What is an Antecedent?)</b>:<br><br>The word antecedent refers to the noun that a pronoun is replacing or referring to. The antecedent is usually mentioned before the pronoun in a sentence. It is important that the pronoun and its antecedent agree in number (singular or plural) and gender (male or female) to make the sentence clear.<br><br>For example: 'The girl lost her book.' In this example, 'girl' is the antecedent of the pronoun 'her'.<br><br>Class Discussion: Explain how antecedents help us understand who or what the pronoun is referring to.",
      "<b>Part 3: Pronouns and Antecedents Must Agree</b>:<br><br>For a sentence to make sense, the pronoun must agree with the antecedent in both gender and number.<br><br>1. Gender Agreement: He (for males) and she (for females) should match the gender of the antecedent.<br>Example: 'The boy went to the store. He bought an apple.' In this case, 'he' agrees with the antecedent 'boy'.<br><br>2. Number Agreement: A singular antecedent must have a singular pronoun, and a plural antecedent must have a plural pronoun.<br>Example (singular): 'The dog is barking. It is very loud.'<br>Example (plural): 'The dogs are barking. They are very loud.'<br><br>Discussion: Ask students for other examples where pronouns and antecedents agree in gender and number.",
      "<b>Part 4: Common Mistakes with Pronouns and Antecedents</b>:<br><br>Sometimes, students make mistakes when pronouns don’t agree with their antecedents. Here are some common mistakes to watch for:<br><br>1. Using he for a girl (incorrect: 'The girl went to the store. He bought apples.')<br>2. Using they for a singular noun (incorrect: 'The boy lost their ball.')<br>3. Forgetting to use a pronoun when it is needed (incorrect: 'The boy went to the park. The boy played basketball.')<br><br>Class Discussion: Discuss why these mistakes happen and how to avoid them.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Pronouns and Antecedents)</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read the sentences below and identify the pronoun and its antecedent. Circle the pronoun and underline its antecedent. Then, write whether they agree in gender and number.<br><br>1. The teacher gave her students some homework.<br>2. The cats are sleeping. They look peaceful.<br>3. Liam is running to the park. He is late.<br>4. The boys finished their homework before dinner.<br>5. My sister is going to the store. She needs some milk.<br><br>Bonus Task: Create your own sentences using a pronoun and its antecedent, making sure they agree in gender and number. Write two sentences and share them with the class."
