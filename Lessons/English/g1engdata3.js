      "<b>Types of Articles:</b><br>There are two main types of articles: 'the' (definite article) and 'a/an' (indefinite articles). 'The' is used when talking about something specific, while 'a/an' is used when talking about something general.",
      "<b>Using 'The':</b><br>'The' is a definite article that refers to something specific. For example: 'The cat is on the roof.' Here, 'the' shows we are talking about a particular cat.",
      "<b>Nouns and Articles:</b><br>A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. Articles work with nouns to show whether we are talking about something specific or general. For example, in the sentence 'The mouse is eating,' 'the' tells us about a specific mouse.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Identify the article and noun: 'The bird is chirping.'<br>2. Find the article and underline the noun: 'The car is parked outside.'<br>3.

      "<b>Part 2: Rules for Choosing Between 'A' and 'An':</b><br>Always listen to the sound that follows the article. Even if a word starts with a vowel letter, it may sound like a consonant, and vice versa. For example, 'a university' (sounds like it starts with a 'y' sound) and 'an hour' (silent 'h' makes it sound like it starts with a vowel).",
