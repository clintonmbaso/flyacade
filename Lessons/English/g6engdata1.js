      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sentences</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must have a subject and a predicate, and make sense on its own.<br><br>Example: 'The cat sleeps on the mat.' This is a complete thought because it tells us what the cat does and where.<br><br>Important Point: Every sentence begins with a capital letter.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sentence Fragments</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject, a predicate, or both.<br><br>Example: 'Running fast through the park.' This is a fragment because it doesn't tell us who is running or provide a full idea.<br><br>How to Fix Fragments: Combine the fragment with a complete sentence or add the missing parts.<br><br>Fixed Example: 'The dog is running fast through the park.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Types of Sentences</b>:<br><br><b>Declarative Sentences:</b> These sentences make a statement. They end with a period.<br>Example: 'I enjoy reading books.'<br><br><b>Interrogative Sentences:</b> These sentences ask a question. They end with a question mark.<br>Example: 'What time is it?'<br><br><b>Exclamatory Sentences:</b> These express strong feelings. They end with an exclamation mark.<br>Example: 'Wow, that was amazing!'<br><br><b>Imperative Sentences:</b> These give commands or requests. They can end with a period or an exclamation mark.<br>Example: 'Please pass the salt.' / 'Stop right there!'",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Identifying Sentence Types</b>:<br><br>Activity: Review several sentences and ask the students to identify whether they are declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, or imperative. Write them on the board and discuss why each sentence fits into a particular category.<br><br>Examples:<br>1. 'I have a new bicycle.' (Declarative)<br>2. 'How old are you?' (Interrogative)<br>3. 'Watch out!' (Exclamatory)<br>4. 'Close the door.' (Imperative)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Provide students with a worksheet containing a list of sentences. They will need to:<br><br>1. Identify whether each sentence is a declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, or imperative sentence.<br><br>2. Rewrite any sentence fragments as complete sentences.<br><br>Example Worksheet:<br>1. 'Do you like pizza' (Answer: Interrogative)<br>2. 'She plays the piano.' (Answer: Declarative)<br>3. 'Running fast in the race.' (Rewrite: 'He is running fast in the race.')<br>4.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Imperative Sentences</b>:<br><br>An imperative sentence is a type of sentence that gives a command or makes a request. When you want someone to do something, you use an imperative sentence. These sentences can be polite or direct, depending on the tone. For example:<br>'Please close the door.'<br>'Sit down.'<br>'Pass me the book.'<br><br>Imperative sentences always end with a period, but when the sentence is forceful or demanding, it can end with an exclamation point.",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Exclamatory Sentences</b>:<br><br>An exclamatory sentence is used to express a strong feeling or emotion. It conveys excitement, surprise, anger, joy, or other intense emotions. For example:<br>'Wow, that was amazing!'<br>'I can't believe we won!'<br>'What a beautiful sunset!'<br><br>Exclamatory sentences always end with an exclamation point. These sentences are meant to grab attention and show emotion.",

      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Imperative and Exclamatory Sentences)</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read the following sentences and decide if they are imperative or exclamatory. Write “Imperative” or “Exclamatory” next to each sentence.<br>1. 'Close the door behind you.'<br>2. 'Wow, that was an incredible performance!'<br>3. 'Please send me the report by tomorrow.'<br>4. 'I can’t wait for the weekend!'<br>5. 'Take your shoes off before entering the house.'<br>6. 'What a beautiful day it is today!'<br>7. 'Could you please pass the pen?'<br>8.

      "<b>Part 2: Independent Clauses</b>:<br><br>An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence. It expresses a complete thought and does not need any additional information.<br><br>Example:<br>'I went to the store.'<br>This is an independent clause because it expresses a complete idea and can stand alone as a sentence.",
      "<b>Part 3: Dependent Clauses</b>:<br><br>A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence. It does not express a complete thought and depends on an independent clause to complete its meaning.<br><br>Example:<br>'Because I was tired'<br>This is a dependent clause because it leaves us wondering what happened because the person was tired. We need additional information to complete the thought.<br><br>Dependent clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions such as wherever, before, while, because, as if, unless, etc.<br>Example: 'Because it was raining'<br>This is dependent because it does not express a full idea on its own.",
      "<b>Part 4: Connecting Independent and Dependent Clauses</b>:<br><br>Dependent clauses need to be connected to independent clauses to form complete sentences. These connections often use conjunctions to link the clauses together.<br><br>Example:<br>'I stayed home because it was raining.'<br>Independent clause: 'I stayed home'<br>Dependent clause: 'because it was raining'<br><br>The conjunction 'because' connects the two clauses and completes the thought.",

Circle 'I' for independent and 'D' for dependent.<br><br>1. Because I forgot my homework, I missed the lesson. ___<br>2. She enjoys reading books. ___<br>3. Unless you hurry, you will miss the bus. ___<br>4. The dog barked loudly. ___<br>5. While we were waiting for the bus, it started to rain. ___<br><br>Answer Key:<br>1. D (dependent)<br>2.
