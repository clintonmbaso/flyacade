      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sentences</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must have a subject and a predicate, and make sense on its own.<br><br>Example: 'The cat sleeps on the mat.' This is a complete thought because it tells us what the cat does and where.<br><br>Important Point: Every sentence begins with a capital letter.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sentence Fragments</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject, a predicate, or both.<br><br>Example: 'Running fast through the park.' This is a fragment because it doesn't tell us who is running or provide a full idea.<br><br>How to Fix Fragments: Combine the fragment with a complete sentence or add the missing parts.<br><br>Fixed Example: 'The dog is running fast through the park.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Types of Sentences</b>:<br><br><b>Declarative Sentences:</b> These sentences make a statement. They end with a period.<br>Example: 'I enjoy reading books.'<br><br><b>Interrogative Sentences:</b> These sentences ask a question. They end with a question mark.<br>Example: 'What time is it?'<br><br><b>Exclamatory Sentences:</b> These express strong feelings. They end with an exclamation mark.<br>Example: 'Wow, that was amazing!'<br><br><b>Imperative Sentences:</b> These give commands or requests. They can end with a period or an exclamation mark.<br>Example: 'Please pass the salt.' / 'Stop right there!'",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Identifying Sentence Types</b>:<br><br>Activity: Review several sentences and ask the students to identify whether they are declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, or imperative. Write them on the board and discuss why each sentence fits into a particular category.<br><br>Examples:<br>1. 'I have a new bicycle.' (Declarative)<br>2. 'How old are you?' (Interrogative)<br>3. 'Watch out!' (Exclamatory)<br>4. 'Close the door.' (Imperative)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Provide students with a worksheet containing a list of sentences. They will need to:<br><br>1. Identify whether each sentence is a declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, or imperative sentence.<br><br>2. Rewrite any sentence fragments as complete sentences.<br><br>Example Worksheet:<br>1. 'Do you like pizza' (Answer: Interrogative)<br>2. 'She plays the piano.' (Answer: Declarative)<br>3. 'Running fast in the race.' (Rewrite: 'He is running fast in the race.')<br>4. 'Wow, that was fun!' (Answer: Exclamatory)"

    "<b>Exercise</b>: The worksheet will evaluate students' ability to identify sentence types and rewrite sentence fragments correctly."

  "conclusion": [
    "By the end of the lesson, students will have a clear understanding of the structure and types of sentences, as well as the ability to identify and correct sentence fragments."

    "Understanding the function and structure of clauses is crucial for building strong, grammatically correct sentences."

  "methodology": [
    "The lesson will use explanations, examples, and exercises to help students identify and create independent and dependent clauses."

    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Clauses</b>:<br><br>A clause is a group of words that contains a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what the subject does or is).<br><br>Example:<br>'She ran quickly.'<br>Subject: 'She'<br>Predicate: 'ran quickly'<br><br>There are two types of clauses: independent clauses and dependent clauses.",
      "<b>Part 2: Independent Clauses</b>:<br><br>An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence. It expresses a complete thought and does not need any additional information.<br><br>Example:<br>'I went to the store.'<br>This is an independent clause because it expresses a complete idea and can stand alone as a sentence.",
      "<b>Part 3: Dependent Clauses</b>:<br><br>A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence. It does not express a complete thought and depends on an independent clause to complete its meaning.<br><br>Example:<br>'Because I was tired'<br>This is a dependent clause because it leaves us wondering what happened because the person was tired. We need additional information to complete the thought.<br><br>Dependent clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions such as wherever, before, while, because, as if, unless, etc.<br>Example: 'Because it was raining'<br>This is dependent because it does not express a full idea on its own.",
      "<b>Part 4: Connecting Independent and Dependent Clauses</b>:<br><br>Dependent clauses need to be connected to independent clauses to form complete sentences. These connections often use conjunctions to link the clauses together.<br><br>Example:<br>'I stayed home because it was raining.'<br>Independent clause: 'I stayed home'<br>Dependent clause: 'because it was raining'<br><br>The conjunction 'because' connects the two clauses and completes the thought.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Identifying Clauses</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Below are some sentences. Identify whether each clause is an independent or dependent clause. Circle 'I' for independent and 'D' for dependent.<br><br>1. Because I forgot my homework, I missed the lesson. ___<br>2. She enjoys reading books. ___<br>3. Unless you hurry, you will miss the bus. ___<br>4. The dog barked loudly. ___<br>5. While we were waiting for the bus, it started to rain. ___<br><br>Answer Key:<br>1. D (dependent)<br>2. I (independent)<br>3. D (dependent)<br>4. I (independent)<br>5. D (dependent)"

  "assessments": [
    "<b>Exercise</b>: The students' ability to identify independent and dependent clauses in the exercise will assess their understanding of clauses.",
    "<b>Observation</b>: The teacher will observe students' participation during the explanation and exercises to ensure comprehension."

  "conclusion": [
    "By understanding the difference between independent and dependent clauses, students will be able to construct more complex and grammatically correct sentences."
