The simple predicate is the main word in the complete predicate, often a verb. For example, in 'The cat sleeps on the mat,' the complete predicate is 'sleeps on the mat,' and the simple predicate is 'sleeps.'",
      "<b>Identifying Subjects and Predicates in Sentences:</b><br>To identify the subject, ask 'Who or what is this sentence about?' To identify the predicate, ask 'What does the subject do?' This strategy helps break down sentences easily. For example, in 'My friend plays the guitar,' 'My friend' is the subject, and 'plays the guitar' is the predicate.",

Identify the subject and predicate: 'The teacher explains the lesson clearly.'<br>6. Find the simple subject: 'A large tree fell in the storm.'<br>7. What is the complete predicate? 'The boy with the red hat kicked the ball.'<br>8. Write a sentence with a simple subject and simple predicate.<br>9. Circle the complete subject: 'The fast runner won the race easily.'<br>10. Underline the complete predicate: 'The baby is sleeping in the crib.'"

      "<b>Using 'and,' 'but,' and 'or' in Compound Sentences:</b><br>These conjunctions are used to connect two independent clauses into one compound sentence. 'And' adds information, 'but' shows contrast, and 'or' offers a choice. For example: 'She likes ice cream, but he prefers cake.'",
      "<b>Conjunctions That Show Time, Place, Reason, Manner, or Conditions:</b><br>Conjunctions such as 'after,' 'because,' and 'if' can connect clauses and add meaning to sentences.

      "<b>Examples of Conjunctions:</b><br>Common conjunctions include: 'after,' 'although,' 'as,' 'because,' 'before,' 'if,' 'since,' 'so that,' 'until,' 'when,' 'whether,' and 'while.' Each of these conjunctions helps join ideas and provide a clear relationship between them.",
      "<b>Identifying Conjunctions in Sentences:</b><br>To find conjunctions, look for words that connect clauses or phrases. For example: 'I will wait until you arrive.' The conjunction 'until' connects the action of waiting to the condition of arrival.",

      "<b>What are Complex Sentences?</b><br>A complex sentence contains two related ideas that are connected by a conjunction other than 'and,' 'but,' or 'or.' These sentences add depth to writing by showing how ideas are related in time, cause, condition, or reason. For example: 'I stayed home because it was raining.'",
      "<b>Common Conjunctions in Complex Sentences:</b><br>Conjunctions such as 'after,' 'although,' 'as,' 'because,' 'before,' 'if,' 'since,' 'so that,' 'until,' 'when,' 'whether,' and 'while' are used to connect the related ideas in complex sentences. These words help show the relationship between the parts of the sentence.",
      "<b>Position of Conjunctions:</b><br>The conjunction in a complex sentence can appear at the beginning or in the middle. When it starts the sentence, the dependent part comes first, followed by a comma and the main idea. For example: 'Although it was late, she still went for a walk.' Here, 'although' starts the sentence, so a comma is used to separate the ideas.",
      "<b>Punctuation Rules for Complex Sentences:</b><br>If the complex sentence begins with the conjunction, a comma should follow the last word of that part. However, if the conjunction is in the middle, the comma is often unnecessary. For example: 'She went for a walk although it was late.' No comma is needed because 'although' is in the middle.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Identify the conjunction: 'After the game ended, we went home.'<br>2. Add the correct punctuation: 'Since he was tired he went to bed early.'<br>3. Write a complex sentence using 'because.'<br>4. Place the comma where needed: 'If you finish your work we can go outside.'<br>5. Identify the conjunction: 'We will stay inside until the rain stops.'<br>6. Correct the punctuation: 'She cleaned the house because guests were coming.'<br>7. Write a sentence with 'although' at the beginning and punctuate it correctly.<br>8. Combine these ideas into a complex sentence: 'I was hungry. I waited until dinner.'<br>9. Find the conjunction: 'He will pass the test if he studies hard.'<br>10. Create a complex sentence using 'while' and include the correct punctuation."

      "<b>What Are Run-On Sentences?</b><br>A run-on sentence occurs when two or more complete thoughts are joined together without proper punctuation or connecting words. For example: 'The sun is high put on some sunscreen.' This sentence runs together without a pause, making it difficult to read.",
      "<b>Identifying Run-On Sentences:</b><br>Run-on sentences often lack punctuation between separate ideas or improperly connect sentences. Look for places where the sentence feels rushed or where multiple ideas are presented without clear breaks. For example, 'I love to read I don’t have much time.' The lack of punctuation creates a run-on.",

For example, the run-on 'She ran to the store she forgot her wallet' can be corrected to: 'She ran to the store. She forgot her wallet.'",
      "<b>Rewriting Run-On Sentences as Compound Sentences:</b><br>Another method is to join the sentences using a comma followed by a conjunction like 'and,' 'but,' or 'or.'

      "<b>Run-On Sentences:</b><br>A run-on sentence incorrectly joins two or more independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions. For example: 'I love to read I go to the library every week.' This should be corrected by separating the sentences or using a conjunction: 'I love to read. I go to the library every week.' or 'I love to read, and I go to the library every week.'",
      "<b>Correcting Run-On Sentences:</b><br>To correct a run-on sentence, you can separate the ideas into two sentences or combine them using a comma and a conjunction. For instance: 'She likes chocolate, but he prefers vanilla.' This fixes the run-on issue by clearly connecting the two ideas.",
      "<b>Sentence Fragments:</b><br>A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that lacks a complete thought. It may be missing a subject, verb, or both. For example: 'After the movie.'

For example: 'I went to the store I bought some milk.' This sentence should be broken into two separate sentences or corrected using appropriate punctuation.",
      "<b>Correcting Run-On Sentences:</b><br>Run-on sentences can be corrected in several ways. You can break them into separate sentences: 'I went to the store. I bought some milk.'

Ensure to add a comma before 'and,' 'but,' 'or,' or 'nor' when forming compound sentences.",
      "<b>Using Commas in Compound Sentences:</b><br>When rewriting run-on sentences as compound sentences, use a comma before conjunctions like 'and,' 'but,' 'or,' and 'nor.' For example: 'She wanted to go hiking, but it started raining.' This helps separate the clauses clearly.",
      "<b>Using Commas in Lists:</b><br>Commas are also used to separate three or more words or phrases in a series. For example: 'We bought apples, oranges, bananas, and grapes.' This ensures clarity in the list of items.",

      "<b>Plural Nouns:</b><br>A plural noun names more than one person, place, or thing. To form the plural of most nouns, add -s or -es. For example: 'cat' becomes 'cats,' and 'box' becomes 'boxes.' Note that apostrophes are not used to form plurals. For example: 'The dogs are playing outside.'",
      "<b>Rules for Adding -s and -es:</b><br>Most nouns simply add -s to become plural, such as 'books' or 'cars.' Nouns ending in -s, -x, -z, -sh, or -ch typically add -es to form the plural, such as 'wishes' or 'batches.'",
      "<b>Possessive Nouns:</b><br>A possessive noun shows who or what owns or has something. For example: 'Sarah's book' indicates that the book belongs to Sarah. For singular nouns, add -'s (e.g., 'the teacher's desk'). For plural nouns ending in -s, add only an apostrophe (e.g., 'the teachers' lounge').",
      "<b>Identifying Plurals and Possessives:</b><br>To identify a plural noun, look for words that represent more than one item and check if they end in -s or -es. To find possessive nouns, look for ownership and check for -'s or -s'. For example, 'the cat's toy' shows ownership, while 'the cats' toys' shows ownership by multiple cats.",

For example: 'the dogs' park' shows that the park belongs to multiple dogs.",
      "<b>Examples and Practice:</b><br>We will look at examples such as 'teacher' becoming 'teachers' for plural, and 'James' becoming 'James's' for possessive. For plural possessive, like 'students' books,' add just the apostrophe after the -s.",
