      "<b>What are Prepositions?</b><br>Prepositions are words that help describe where something is. They tell us the position of one thing in relation to another. Prepositions are essential in English because they help us understand how objects are placed relative to each other.",
      "<b>Examples of Prepositions:</b><br>Common prepositions include: on, under, over, beside, to, near, above, around, into, by, in, along, onto, between, at. These words are used frequently in everyday sentences to indicate position.",
      "<b>Using Prepositions in Sentences:</b><br>Prepositions are often found in sentences where they help describe the placement of objects. For example: 'The kite is over the ground.' Here, 'over' tells us the kite’s position relative to the ground.",
      "<b>Identifying Prepositions:</b><br>To find the preposition in a sentence, look for words that tell the position or location of something. For example: 'The cat is under the table.' The word 'under' is the preposition describing where the cat is.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. What is a preposition?<br>2. Name five common prepositions.<br>3. Identify the preposition: 'The cat is under the table.'<br>4.
