      "<b>What are Prepositions?</b><br>Prepositions are words that help describe where something is. They tell us the position of one thing in relation to another. Prepositions are essential in English because they help us understand how objects are placed relative to each other.",
      "<b>Examples of Prepositions:</b><br>Common prepositions include: on, under, over, beside, to, near, above, around, into, by, in, along, onto, between, at. These words are used frequently in everyday sentences to indicate position.",
      "<b>Using Prepositions in Sentences:</b><br>Prepositions are often found in sentences where they help describe the placement of objects. For example: 'The kite is over the ground.' Here, 'over' tells us the kite’s position relative to the ground.",
      "<b>Identifying Prepositions:</b><br>To find the preposition in a sentence, look for words that tell the position or location of something. For example: 'The cat is under the table.' The word 'under' is the preposition describing where the cat is.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. What is a preposition?<br>2. Name five common prepositions.<br>3. Identify the preposition: 'The cat is under the table.'<br>4.

      "<b>Choosing the Correct Preposition:</b><br>To complete a sentence correctly, you need to choose the right preposition that fits the context. For example: 'The cat is under the chair,' not 'The cat is on the chair' if the position is below the chair.",
      "<b>Identifying Prepositions in Sentences:</b><br>To identify a preposition, look for the word that shows time or location. In the sentence 'The book is on the shelf,' the word 'on' is the preposition, as it tells us where the book is.",
