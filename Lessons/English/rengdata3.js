  "rationale": [
    "Learning CVC words with short vowel sounds helps early readers decode words and improve their phonemic awareness. Mastery of these foundational sounds is essential for reading fluency and comprehension."
  ],
  "methodology": [
    "This lesson will use a combination of direct instruction, sound-blending practice, and hands-on activities to teach students the short 'a' sound in CVC words. Students will practice recognizing, sounding out, and spelling short 'a' words through interactive games and sorting exercises."

      "<b>Introduction to Short 'a' Sound:</b><br>The short 'a' sound is the vowel sound in words like 'cat,' 'bat,' and 'mat.' It is a quick, sharp sound like /æ/ (as in 'apple'). To pronounce the short 'a,' open your mouth wide and say the sound quickly. Practice with words like 'cat,' 'can,' and 'hat.' Have students repeat after you to get familiar with the sound.",
      "<b>What are CVC Words?:</b><br>CVC words are made up of three sounds: a consonant, a vowel, and another consonant. The short 'a' sound is commonly found in these simple words. Examples of short 'a' CVC words include 'cat,' 'bat,' 'pan,' and 'jam.' Break the words down into their individual sounds (C-V-C) and have students practice identifying the sounds.",
      "<b>Sounding Out Short 'a' CVC Words:</b><br>To sound out CVC words, start with the first consonant, then move to the short 'a' vowel, and end with the last consonant. For example, in 'cat,' sound out each letter slowly: /k/ /æ/ /t/, then blend the sounds together. Have students take turns sounding out words like 'bat,' 'rat,' and 'fan' aloud. Offer support and praise as they improve.",
      "<b>Fun Activities to Reinforce Learning:</b><br>1. Word Sorting Activity: Students will sort a group of words into two categories—those with the short 'a' sound and those with different vowel sounds (e.g., short 'e' or 'o'). This activity helps reinforce their understanding of the short 'a' sound.<br>2. Clap and Say the Words: Say a CVC word with the short 'a' sound (e.g., 'cat'), and have students clap once for each sound they hear (/k/ /æ/ /t/). This helps break down the sounds while keeping students engaged."

  "exerciseQuestions": [
    "1. What sound does the short 'a' make in the word 'cat'?",
    "2. Circle the word that has the short 'a' sound: (bat / bet / bit)",
