      "<b>What is a Verb?</b><br>A verb is a word that shows what the subject of a sentence does or is. Verbs are essential because they tell us about the actions or states of the subject in the sentence. For example, in the sentence 'The dog barks,' the word 'barks' is the verb because it tells us what the dog does.",
      "<b>What is an Action Verb?</b><br>An action verb is a specific type of verb that expresses an action. It tells what a subject does or did. For example, in the sentence 'She runs every morning,' the word 'runs' is an action verb because it describes what the subject 'She' does.",
      "<b>Examples of Action Verbs:</b><br>Action verbs include words like run, jump, eat, swim, sing, and write. These verbs are commonly used to describe the actions people, animals, or things perform. For instance: 'The cat sleeps,' 'The children play,' and 'The teacher writes on the board.'",
      "<b>Identifying Action Verbs in Sentences:</b><br>To find the action verb in a sentence, look for the word that shows what the subject is doing. For example, in 'The boy kicks the ball,' the action verb is 'kicks' because it shows the action performed by the boy.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Identify the verb in this sentence: 'The bird flies.'<br>2. Find the action verb: 'The girl dances gracefully.'<br>3. What is the action verb in: 'The chef cooks delicious meals.'?<br>4. Choose the action verb: 'The baby cries loudly.'<br>5. Write a sentence using the action verb 'run.'<br>6. Circle the action verb: 'They jump over the puddle.'<br>7. Which word shows action? 'The dog chases the cat.'<br>8. Fill in the blank with an action verb: 'The fish ___ in the pond.' (Options: swim, sings)<br>9. Write a sentence using any action verb of your choice.<br>10. Underline the action verb: 'The sun shines brightly in the sky.'"

For instance: 'The dog barks.' This sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period, which is correct punctuation for a statement.",
      "<b>Commas in a Series:</b><br>Commas are used to separate items in a list of three or more words, phrases, or clauses to avoid confusion. For example: 'I bought apples, oranges, and bananas.' The commas separate each item in the list, making the sentence clear and easy to read.",
      "<b>Correcting Sentences:</b><br>Let's correct some example sentences together. Look at this sentence: 'He walk, talk, and eats.' The subject 'He' is singular, so all verbs should match: 'He walks, talks, and eats.' Also, ensure each sentence starts with a capital letter and uses commas correctly in lists.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Correct the subject-verb agreement: 'She walk to school every day.'<br>2. Rewrite with proper punctuation: 'do you like apples'<br>3. Add commas: 'I need milk bread and eggs.'<br>4. Choose the correct verb: 'They (is/are) coming over.'<br>5. Rewrite correctly: 'the cat jumps runs and plays.'<br>6. Correct the sentence: 'He likes to swim bike, and run.'<br>7. Fix capitalization and punctuation: 'they went to the park.'<br>8. Add commas: 'We saw lions tigers and bears at the zoo.'<br>9. Correct the verb: 'The dogs barks loudly.'<br>10. Rewrite the sentence correctly: 'My mom dad and sister went shopping.'"

Poets often break sentences into two or more lines to create rhythm, emphasize certain words, or create visual interest. For example: 'The sun / sets slowly / behind the hills.' Each line breaks the sentence in a way that draws the reader’s attention to different parts of the image.",
      "<b>Reading Punctuation in Poetry:</b><br>When reading poetry, punctuation marks such as commas or periods signal pauses. A comma at the end of a line indicates a brief pause, while a period suggests a longer pause. If a line ends without punctuation, no pause is needed. For example: 'The wind blows, / soft and gentle.' Here, the comma tells the reader to pause slightly before continuing.",
      "<b>Capitalization in Poetry:</b><br>Many poems start each line with a capital letter, even if the line does not begin a new sentence. This style choice helps to distinguish the lines and adds to the visual format of the poem. For example: 'The Moon rises / High above / The quiet sea.' Each line begins with a capital letter to maintain the poem’s structure.",
      "<b>Analyzing a Poem:</b><br>Students will read a short poem and identify how the poet uses line breaks, punctuation, and capitalization. Discuss why the poet might have chosen to break the lines in specific places and how punctuation affects the reading of the poem.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Read the poem: 'The stars shine / bright tonight.' Where should the reader pause?<br>2. Identify the punctuation: 'The river flows, / quietly by.'<br>3. Why do poets often start each line with a capital letter?<br>4. Write a short poem with line breaks, using at least three lines.<br>5. Correctly read aloud: 'Whispering wind / through the trees.'<br>6. Find a poem in your textbook and point out where punctuation creates pauses.<br>7. Write two lines of poetry with no punctuation at the end.<br>8. Describe the effect of line breaks in a poem you have read.<br>9. What happens if a line ends without punctuation?<br>10. Write a sentence, then break it into three lines as if it were a poem."

      "<b>What Are Linking Verbs?</b><br>Linking verbs do not show action. Instead, they show a state of being or a condition. They link the subject of a sentence with a noun or an adjective that describes it. For example, in the sentence 'The sky is blue,' 'is' is the linking verb connecting 'sky' with 'blue.'",
      "<b>Common Linking Verbs:</b><br>Some common linking verbs are: am, is, are, was, were, will be, seem, appear, look, taste, feel, and felt. These verbs help connect the subject of a sentence to a word that describes or identifies it.",
      "<b>Linking Verbs and Nouns/Adjectives:</b><br>Linking verbs connect the subject to a noun or an adjective that provides more information about the subject. For example: 'She feels happy.' Here, 'feels' links 'She' with 'happy,' which describes her state.",
      "<b>Agreement Between Subjects and Linking Verbs:</b><br>Subjects and linking verbs must agree in number. This means that a singular subject requires a singular linking verb, and a plural subject requires a plural linking verb. For example: 'The cat is tired.' (singular) vs. 'The cats are tired.' (plural)",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Identify the linking verb in the sentence: 'The cake smells delicious.'<br>2. Complete the sentence with the correct linking verb: 'The weather ___ nice today.' (Options: is, are)<br>3. Write a sentence using 'feel' as a linking verb.<br>4. Correct the sentence: 'The kids was excited for the trip.'<br>5. Choose the correct linking verb: 'She ___ a teacher.'

Recognizing the antecedent helps clarify what the pronoun is referring to in a sentence.",
      "<b>Matching Pronouns to Antecedents:</b><br>To use pronouns correctly, match them with their antecedents in terms of number and sometimes gender. For example, 'The boys are playing because they enjoy soccer.' Here, 'they' refers to the antecedent 'boys,' a plural noun, so the pronoun is plural as well.",

      "<b>Introduction to Subject and Object Pronouns:</b><br>Pronouns are words that replace nouns. There are different types of pronouns, including subject pronouns and object pronouns. Subject pronouns include 'I,' 'you,' 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'we,' and 'they.' Object pronouns include 'me,' 'you,' 'him,' 'her,' 'it,' 'us,' and 'them.' Understanding when to use each type is essential for forming correct sentences.",
      "<b>Using Subject Pronouns:</b><br>A subject pronoun is used as the subject of a sentence. It tells who or what the sentence is about. For example, in the sentence 'She is reading a book,' 'she' is the subject pronoun because it tells us who is doing the action. Subject pronouns take the place of nouns that are the doers of the action in the sentence.",
      "<b>Using Object Pronouns:</b><br>An object pronoun is used after an action verb or after words like 'for,' 'at,' 'of,' 'with,' or 'to.' For example, in the sentence 'The teacher gave her a book,' 'her' is the object pronoun because it is used after the verb 'gave' to show who received the action. Object pronouns replace nouns that are the receivers of the action.",
      "<b>Combining Sentences with Pronouns:</b><br>You can combine two sentences by using pronouns. For example, 'Sam saw the movie. Sam liked it.' This can be combined as 'Sam saw the movie, and he liked it.' Here, 'he' replaces the noun 'Sam,' showing how pronouns simplify sentences.",
      "<b>Class Exercise:</b><br>1. Use a subject pronoun: '___ (he/she) is my friend.'<br>2. Identify the object pronoun: 'The cat sat on ___ (him/her).' <br>3.

These can be used before nouns, as in 'my pencil,' or alone, as in 'That book is mine.'<br>When used before nouns, possessive pronouns describe ownership, as in 'Their house is big.' When used alone, they replace the noun entirely, as in 'This is hers.'",

      "<b>Possessive Pronouns:</b><br>A possessive pronoun takes the place of a possessive noun and shows ownership. Examples include: 'my,' 'your,' 'his,' 'her,' 'its,' 'our,' 'their.' For example, instead of saying 'Sarah's book,' you can say 'her book.' Some possessive pronouns are used before nouns (e.g., 'my book') while others stand alone (e.g., 'The book is hers.').",
      "<b>Using Possessive Pronouns:</b><br>Possessive pronouns show who or what owns something. For instance, 'This is my pen' uses 'my' before the noun 'pen' to show ownership. In 'The pen is mine,' 'mine' stands alone to show that the pen belongs to the speaker.",
