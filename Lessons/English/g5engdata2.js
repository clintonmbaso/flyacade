Some verbs show a state of being.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>Action verb: The girl dances.<br>State of being verb: The girl is tall.<br><br><b>Quick Tip:</b><br>If you can do it with your body, it’s usually an action verb!",
      "<b>Part 4: Using Verbs in Sentences</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Learners will form sentences using verbs and action verbs.<br><br><b>Guided Practice:</b><br>Ask students to create two sentences:<br>1. One with a state-of-being verb (like “is”, “am”, “are”).<br>2. One with an action verb (like “run”, “play”, “talk”).<br><br><b>Example Answers:</b><br>My sister is a nurse.<br>My sister runs every morning.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Individual Work)</b>:<br><br><b>Instructions:</b><br>A. Underline the verb in each sentence.<br>B. Circle the action verb if it is an action verb.<br>C. Write your own sentence with an action verb.<br><br><b>Questions:</b><br>1. The baby cries loudly.<br>2. We are in the classroom.<br>3. He plays football every day.<br>4. They are singing a song.<br>5. The sun is hot.<br>6. I read my book after lunch.<br>7. She dances at the party.<br>8. The children were happy.<br>9. Tom thinks about his homework.<br>10.

For example, in the sentence, 'She feels happy,' the verb 'feels' links the subject, 'She,' to the adjective, 'happy.'<br><br>Discussion:<br>Can you identify any of these linking verbs in your own sentences?",
      "<b>Part 3: Linking Verbs and Agreement</b>:<br><br>Just like other verbs, linking verbs must agree with the subject in number and person. Singular subjects use singular linking verbs, e.g., 'The dog is friendly.' Plural subjects use plural linking verbs, e.g., 'The dogs are friendly.'<br><br>Explanation:<br>The form of the linking verb changes based on whether the subject is singular or plural.<br><br>Practice Exercise:<br>Provide students with sentences and ask them to identify the subject and the correct linking verb form.",
      "<b>Part 4: Linking Verbs Linking to Nouns and Adjectives</b>:<br><br>A linking verb connects the subject to a noun or an adjective. When a linking verb connects to a noun, it can rename the subject. For example, in the sentence 'The teacher is a great mentor,' the verb 'is' links the subject 'teacher' to the noun 'mentor.' When a linking verb connects to an adjective, it describes the subject. For example, 'The book is interesting,' where the verb 'is' links the subject 'book' to the adjective 'interesting.'<br><br>Discussion:<br>Can you think of an example of a linking verb connecting to a noun? What about to an adjective?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>Task: Underline the linking verbs and circle the words they connect to (either nouns or adjectives).<br><br>1. The sky is clear today.<br>2. My brother looks tired after his long run.<br>3. The cake smells delicious.<br>4. She is a talented singer.<br>5. The flowers feel soft in the garden.<br>6. The dog seems happy with its new toy.<br>7. They were excited for the weekend trip.<br>8. He feels better after taking the medicine.<br>9. The story was interesting to all the students.<br>10.

      "<b>Part 1: Linking Verbs and the Predicate</b>:<br><br>A linking verb connects the subject of a sentence to more information in the predicate. The predicate is the part of the sentence that tells us more about the subject. The linking verb helps to link the subject with either a noun or an adjective in the predicate.<br><br>For example, in the sentence:<br><br>The weather is beautiful.<br>Here, 'is' is the linking verb, and it links the subject 'weather' to the adjective 'beautiful', which describes the subject.",
      "<b>Part 2: Linking Verbs and Nouns</b>:<br><br>When a linking verb connects the subject to a noun, that noun renames or identifies the subject. This means the noun gives us more information about who or what the subject is.<br><br>For example:<br><br>My sister is a teacher.<br>In this sentence, 'is' is the linking verb, and 'teacher' is the noun that renames the subject 'sister'.<br><br>Another example:<br><br>John is the leader of the team.<br>Here, 'is' links the subject 'John' to the noun 'leader', which identifies him.",
      "<b>Part 3: Linking Verbs and Adjectives</b>:<br><br>When a linking verb connects the subject to an adjective, the adjective describes the subject. The adjective tells us more about the characteristics or condition of the subject.<br><br>For example:<br><br>The cake is delicious.<br>The linking verb 'is' connects the subject 'cake' to the adjective 'delicious', which describes how the cake tastes.<br><br>Another example:<br><br>The girl feels happy.<br>In this case, 'feels' links the subject 'girl' to the adjective 'happy', which describes the girl's mood.",
      "<b>Part 4: Identifying Nouns and Adjectives After Linking Verbs</b>:<br><br>It’s important to be able to recognize whether the word following the linking verb is a noun (which renames the subject) or an adjective (which describes the subject).<br><br><b>Noun Example:</b> The teacher is a doctor. (Here, 'doctor' renames the teacher.)<br><br><b>Adjective Example:</b> The teacher is kind. (Here, 'kind' describes the teacher.)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>Task: Underline the linking verbs and identify whether the word that follows is a noun or an adjective.<br><br>1. The dog is a loyal companion.<br>2. The soup tastes delicious.<br>3. My friend is an artist.<br>4. The sky looks clear today.<br>5. He seems upset about the news.<br>6.

      "<b>Part 1: What are Quotation Marks?</b>:<br><br>Quotation marks are punctuation marks used to show that you are directly quoting someone’s words. They help us separate the speaker’s words from the rest of the sentence. For example:<br>He said, 'I will finish my homework soon.'<br>In this sentence, the words 'I will finish my homework soon' are a direct quote, and quotation marks are used to set them off from the rest of the sentence.",
      "<b>Part 2: Using a Comma Before the Quotation</b>:<br><br>When the speaker's name or introductory phrase comes first in the sentence, you should use a comma before the quotation. The comma signals that someone is about to speak.<br>For example:<br>John said, 'I am going to the park.'<br>In this sentence, John said introduces the quotation, so a comma is placed before the quotation marks.<br>Other examples:<br>Mom asked, 'Are you ready for dinner?'<br>The teacher said, 'Please complete your homework.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Ending the Quotation with Punctuation</b>:<br><br>When the speaker’s name comes last in the sentence, the punctuation mark used to end the quotation can be a comma, question mark, or exclamation mark, depending on the sentence.<br>1. Comma:<br>If the sentence ends with a statement, use a comma after the quotation marks.<br>'I love reading,' she said.<br>2. Question Mark:<br>If the sentence ends with a question, use a question mark after the quotation marks.<br>'Do you want to play?' he asked.<br>3. Exclamation Mark:<br>If the sentence ends with an exclamation, use an exclamation mark after the quotation marks.<br>'This is amazing!' she shouted.",
      "<b>Part 4: Putting It All Together</b>:<br><br>Let’s practice combining what we’ve learned about using quotation marks, commas, and ending punctuation. Here are some examples:<br>'We will go to the zoo tomorrow,' said Sarah. (comma before the quote because the speaker’s name comes last)<br>'Can we go to the beach?' asked Jake. (question mark after the quote)<br>'Wow! Look at that!' shouted Tim. (exclamation mark after the quote)<br>John replied, 'I’m ready for the test.' (comma before the quote because the speaker’s name comes first)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>1. Sarah asked where are my shoes<br>2. 'I love playing soccer' he said<br>3. Tom exclaimed 'What a beautiful day'<br>4. 'Are we there yet' asked the driver<br>5. Mary said 'I’m so excited for the trip'<br>6. 'Can I help you' she asked<br>7. 'This is the best ice cream ever' shouted Lily<br>8.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Irregular Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will be introduced to the concept of irregular verbs and understand the difference between regular and irregular verbs.<br><br>Explanation: Start by explaining that verbs are action words. For example: run, jump, talk, etc. Regular verbs follow a simple rule when they change from present to past tense. They usually add -ed or -d at the end. Irregular verbs, however, do not follow this rule. Instead of simply adding -ed or -d, they change in different ways. For example: Go becomes went (not 'goed'), Eat becomes ate (not 'eated').<br><br>Examples: Regular verbs: talk → talked, jump → jumped. Irregular verbs: swim → swam, write → wrote.",
      "<b>Part 2: How to Identify Irregular Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will learn how to identify irregular verbs and distinguish them from regular verbs.<br><br>Explanation: Share a list of common irregular verbs and their past tense forms, such as: Begin → Began, Take → Took, See → Saw, Have → Had. Explain that there is no single rule to form the past tense of irregular verbs, so students must learn them individually. Write some sentences on the board using both regular and irregular verbs: 'I walked to school.' (regular), 'I ate breakfast early.' (irregular). Have students identify which verbs are regular and which are irregular in a few example sentences.",
      "<b>Part 3: Categories of Irregular Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will categorize irregular verbs into different types, such as those that stay the same in the past tense, or those that change completely.<br><br>Explanation: Explain that irregular verbs can be grouped into different categories based on how they change in the past tense: No change: Some irregular verbs do not change at all when forming the past tense. Example: Put → Put, Cut → Cut. Vowel change: Some verbs change only their vowel sound. Example: Sing → Sang, Begin → Began. Complete change: Some verbs change completely in the past tense. Example: Go → Went, Buy → Bought.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice & Recognition of Irregular Verbs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will practice identifying and using irregular verbs in sentences.<br><br>Explanation: Provide a list of sentences, some with regular verbs and others with irregular verbs. Have students circle the irregular verbs in each sentence: 'I swam in the pool yesterday.' (irregular), 'She talked to her friend on the phone.' (regular), 'We saw a movie last weekend.' (irregular), 'They played soccer all afternoon.' (regular). Discuss the answers as a class, explaining why certain verbs are irregular.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will apply what they’ve learned by completing an exercise on irregular verbs.<br><br>Exercise: 1. Fill in the blanks with the correct form of the verb in parentheses: Yesterday, I (go) ______ to the park with my friends. She (eat) ______ her lunch already. We (see) ______ a beautiful bird on our hike. They (run) ______ to the store to buy snacks. I (take) ______ the bus to school this morning. 2. Match the verbs to their past tense form: Sing → ______, Take → ______, Go → ______, Buy → ______, Write → ______. (Answer key: Sing → Sang, Take → Took, Go → Went, Buy → Bought, Write → Wrote). 3.

'She was happy yesterday.'<br><br>Regular vs. Irregular Verbs: Regular verbs form the past tense by adding -ed or -d. Irregular verbs do not follow this rule and must be learned individually (e.g., go → went, eat → ate).",

'Water boils at 100°C.'<br><br>Past Tense is used for actions that happened and were completed in the past: 'The dog ran fast yesterday.' 'The water boiled yesterday.'<br><br>Emphasize that regular verbs follow a simple pattern (add -ed), while irregular verbs change in unpredictable ways. Regular: talk → talked, jump → jumped. Irregular: go → went, see → saw.",
      "<b>Part 3: Irregular Verbs with Helping Verbs</b>:<br><br>Helping verbs like have, has, and had are used with the main verb to indicate different tenses: Present: 'She has finished her homework.' Past: 'We had eaten before we left.' Past participle (irregular verbs): 'I have gone to the store.'<br><br>Irregular verbs change form when used with helping verbs, often taking a special form known as the past participle: Go → Gone: 'I have gone to the store.' Eat → Eaten: 'She has eaten lunch.' Write → Written: 'They have written the report.'",
      "<b>Part 4: Correcting the Passage: Verb Tense Practice</b>:<br><br>Provide students with a passage that contains errors in verb tenses.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Subject Pronouns</b>:<br><br>Subject pronouns are words that replace the subject (the person or thing performing the action) in a sentence. The subject pronouns are:<br><br>I<br>You<br>He<br>She<br>It<br>We<br>They<br><br>Example Sentences:<br>I am going to the store.<br>He plays soccer every weekend.<br>They are reading a book.<br><br>These subject pronouns are used to take the place of a specific person or thing, making the sentence easier to read and understand. For instance, instead of saying, 'John is going to the store,' we can use he to replace John: 'He is going to the store.'",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Object Pronouns</b>:<br><br>Object pronouns are used to receive the action of the verb or to follow a preposition in a sentence. The object pronouns are:<br><br>Me<br>You<br>Him<br>Her<br>It<br>Us<br>Them<br><br>Example Sentences:<br>The teacher called me to answer the question.<br>Can you help him with the homework?<br>She gave us the books.<br><br>Explanation:<br>In these sentences, the object pronouns receive the action of the verb (e.g., 'called' or 'help') or follow a preposition (e.g., 'with' in 'help him with the homework').",
      "<b>Part 3: When to Use Subject vs. Object Pronouns</b>:<br><br>Subject Pronouns: Use subject pronouns when the pronoun is the doer of the action (the subject of the sentence).<br>Example: She runs fast.<br><br>Object Pronouns: Use object pronouns when the pronoun is the receiver of the action or follows a preposition.<br>Example: I will call her later.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice with Sentences</b>:<br><br>To better understand how to use subject and object pronouns, let's look at a few sentences.<br><br>Correct the Sentences:<br>John will help he with the project. (Incorrect)<br>I gave the book to she. (Incorrect)<br>The teacher saw we in the hallway. (Incorrect)<br><br>Correct Sentences:<br>John will help him with the project. (Correct)<br>I gave the book to her. (Correct)<br>The teacher saw us in the hallway. (Correct)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Pronoun Practice</b>:<br><br>Now, let's practice! Complete the sentences below by filling in the correct subject or object pronoun.<br><br>Exercise 1:<br>1. ____ (She/Her) is my best friend.<br>2. We saw ____ (them/they) at the park yesterday.<br>3. Can you give ____ (me/I) the pencil, please?<br>4. The dog followed ____ (us/we) home.<br>5. ____ (He/Him) likes to play basketball after school.<br><br>Exercise 2: Correct the mistakes in the following sentences.<br>1. I saw him and she at the store.<br>2. You helped we with our homework.<br>3. They gave the book to I.<br><br>After completing the exercises, review the answers as a class to ensure that everyone understands when to use subject and object pronouns in sentences."

      "<b>Part 3: Using Object Pronouns After Prepositions</b>:<br><br>Object pronouns often come after prepositions. Some common prepositions are: for, at, of, with, to. These words connect the action to the object pronoun. Examples include:<br>She bought a gift for me.<br>They are playing with him.<br>The letter is for her.<br>He sat with us during lunch.<br>I talked to them after class.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Using Object Pronouns After Prepositions and Action Verbs</b>:<br><br>Let's practice how to use object pronouns after action verbs and prepositions. Fill in the blanks with the correct pronoun.<br><br>Exercise 1:<br>1. She is talking ____ (to/you) about the project.<br>2. Can you pass the book ____ (to/her)?<br>3. They are playing soccer ____ (with/them).<br>4. He asked ____ (me/us) to help with the cleanup.<br>5. I sent the invitation ____ (to/her).",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Correct the Sentences</b>:<br><br>Now let’s look at a few sentences. Some of them have mistakes with pronouns. Correct them.<br><br>1.
