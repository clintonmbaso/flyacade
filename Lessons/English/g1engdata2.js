      "<b>Part 1: What is a Verb? (Explanation)</b><br><br>Teacher Says:<br>“Today, we are going to learn about verbs. A verb is a word that shows action. It tells us what someone or something is doing. Just like how we jump, run, eat, or sleep—those are all actions. So, the words we use to talk about these actions are called verbs.”<br><br>Example Words:<br><ul><li>jump</li><li>run</li><li>eat</li><li>play</li><li>sleep</li></ul>",
      "<b>Part 2: Let’s See Verbs in Sentences (Examples)</b><br><br>Teacher Reads:<br>1. The boy runs fast.<br>2. The dog barks loudly.<br>3. I eat my lunch.<br>4. She jumps on the bed.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask the class: “What is the action in each sentence?”<br>Let learners say the verb aloud.",

      "<b>Part 4: Drawing Verbs (Creative Expression)</b><br><br>Activity:<br>Give learners paper and crayons.<br>Ask them to draw one or two actions (verbs) they do at home or school (e.g., eating, jumping, reading).<br>Help them label their drawing with the verb.<br><br>Sharing:<br>Let volunteers show and explain what they drew:<br>“This is me. I am eating.”",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercises (Practice Time)</b><br><br><b>A. Circle the Verbs</b><br>Circle the verb in each sentence:<br>1. I play with my toys.<br>2. She sings a song.<br>3. The cat sleeps on the mat.<br>4. We read a book.<br>5. He kicks the ball.<br><br><b>B. Fill in the Blanks with the Correct Verb</b><br>Choose a verb from the box: (run, jump, eat, sing, sleep)<br><br>1. I ______ in the park.<br>2. We ______ our lunch.<br>3. The baby will ______ now.<br>4. They ______ a song.<br>5. He can ______ very high."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Past Tense Verbs</b><br><br>Teacher says:<br>'Today we are going to learn about past tense verbs. Past tense verbs tell us about actions that already happened. That means something someone did before now. For example, if I say, 'I walk to school,' that is happening now. But if I say, 'I walked to school,' that happened already—maybe this morning or yesterday. So we add -ed to many verbs to show it happened in the past.'<br><br>Give examples with action words:<br><br>Walk → Walked<br><br>Jump → Jumped<br><br>Wash → Washed<br><br>Look → Looked<br><br>Use pictures or act out actions to show the difference between now and past.",

These change in different ways.'<br><br>Examples:<br><br>Go → Went<br><br>Eat → Ate<br><br>Sleep → Slept<br><br>Run → Ran<br><br>Say and repeat together:<br><br>“Today I go to school. Yesterday I went to school.”<br><br>“Today I eat rice. Yesterday I ate rice.”<br><br>Let learners repeat sentences and act out.",

      "<b>Part 1: What is a Contraction?</b>:<br><br>A contraction is a shorter way of saying or writing two words. We take two words, leave out one or more letters, and put an apostrophe (') where the letters were.<br>For example:<br>'Are not' becomes 'aren't.'<br>'Do not' becomes 'don't.'<br>When we use contractions, we make our speech and writing shorter and quicker.",
      "<b>Part 2: How Contractions with 'Not' Work</b>:<br><br>When we combine words with 'not,' the word 'not' changes into a shortened form with an apostrophe. Here's how:<br>Are + not = aren't<br>Do + not = don't<br>Is + not = isn't<br>Can + not = can't<br>Did + not = didn't<br>Could + not = couldn't<br>Has + not = hasn't<br><br>Let’s look at some examples:<br>'We are not going' becomes 'We aren't going.'<br>'They do not want it' becomes 'They don't want it.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Why Use Contractions?</b>:<br><br>We use contractions to make our speech and writing faster and easier. Instead of saying or writing two words, we can say or write one shorter word with an apostrophe. It helps us talk like we do in real life and sounds more natural.<br>For example:<br>Instead of saying “I am not going,” we say “I’m not going.”<br>Instead of saying “She has not called,” we say “She hasn’t called.”",

This is a rule in English writing, and it helps us know where a new sentence starts.<br><br>Example:<br><br>'My name is Sara.' (The sentence starts with a capital letter M in 'My')<br><br>Tell students that capital letters are used at the beginning of a sentence, names (like Sara, Tom), and special places (like London, Africa).<br><br>Ask students to look at some sentences and help identify the capital letters:<br><br>'I like apples.'<br>'Tom goes to school.'<br>'We live in a big city.'",

(The sentence is a question, so it ends with a question mark.)<br>'Where is my pencil?' (The sentence is a question, so it ends with a question mark.)<br><br>Ask the students to help you turn statements into questions by adding a question mark:<br><br>'You are coming to the party.' → 'Are you coming to the party?'<br>'This is my book.' → 'Is this your book?'",
      "<b>Part 4: Difference Between a Period and a Question Mark</b>:<br><br>Help students understand the difference between a statement and a question:<br><br>Statements: Give information, and end with a period.<br>Example: 'I like dogs.'<br><br>Questions: Ask something, and end with a question mark.<br>Example: 'Do you like dogs?'<br><br>Show them a few sentences and have students decide if the sentence needs a period or a question mark.<br><br>'My name is John' (What punctuation does it need?)<br>'How are you?' (What punctuation does it need?)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Task: Choose the correct punctuation for each sentence.<br><br>1. What is your favorite color ________<br>2. I have a new toy ________<br>3. Where do you live ________<br>4. The cat is sleeping ________<br>5. How old are you ________<br>6. We went to the park ________<br>7. What time does school start ________<br>8.
