      "Part 1: Introduction to Action Verbs\n\nObjective: Learners will understand what action verbs are.\n\nTeacher says: Today, we are going to learn about action verbs.\nAn action verb is a word that shows action – it tells what someone or something does.\n\nExamples:\n\nrun, eat, write, jump, laugh\nThese words all show action – they tell us what someone is doing.\n\nDiscussion Prompt:\n\nWhat do you like to do for fun? (Let children answer: play, sing, dance…)\n\nEach of these is an action. The word you say is an action verb.",
      "Part 2: Understanding the Subject and Action\n\nObjective: Learners will identify the subject and action verb in a sentence.\n\nTeacher says: Every sentence has a subject – the person or thing doing the action – and an action verb – what they are doing.\n\nLet’s look at these examples:\n\nCarly sings at parties.\n\nWho is doing something? Carly (Subject)\n\nWhat is she doing? sings (Action verb)\n\nShe talks to her friends.\n\nWho is doing something? She\n\nWhat is she doing? talks\n\nLet’s try one together:\n\nThe boy runs fast.\n\nWho is the subject? (The boy)\n\nWhat is the action verb? (runs)",
      "Part 3: Using Action Verbs in Sentences\n\nObjective: Learners will use action verbs to create their own sentences.\n\nTeacher says: Now let’s use action verbs in our own sentences.\nI will give you some action verbs, and you will make sentences.\n\nAction verbs:\n\nplay\n\njump\n\neat\n\nread\n\nswim\n\nExample:\n\nplay – I play with my brother.\n\neat – She eats an apple.\n\nActivity: Ask learners to pick one verb and make a sentence aloud.",
      "Part 4: Action Verbs Around Us\n\nObjective: Learners will recognize action verbs in real life.\n\nTeacher says: Let’s look around and see actions people are doing right now.\nWhat is your friend doing? Maybe she is writing.\nWhat is the teacher doing? Maybe he is talking.\n\nLet’s make a list on the board of actions we see:\n(write learners’ suggestions: writing, talking, sitting, smiling…)\n\nThese are all action verbs – they show us what people are doing.",
      "Part 5: Exercise – Let’s Practice!\n\nInstructions:\n\nA. Circle the action verb in each sentence:\n\n1. The dog barks loudly.\n\n2. James runs in the field.\n\n3. We sing songs at school.\n\n4. The girl paints a picture.\n\n5. They laugh at the joke.\n\nB. Write your own sentence using these action verbs:\n\n1. jump\n\n2. read\n\n3. cook\n\nC.

      "PART 2: Spelling Rules Review\n\nGo over the spelling rules one more time clearly and slowly:\n\n1. Add -s to most verbs when the subject is singular.\nExample: He walks.\n\n2. Add -es to verbs ending in s, ch, sh, x, or z when the subject is singular.\nExample: She washes her clothes.\n\n3. Change y to i and add -es for verbs ending in a consonant + y when the subject is singular.\nExample: The baby cries.\n\n4. Do not add -s or -es when the subject is plural, or I or you.\nExample: They play, I jump, You run.\n\nUse colorful posters or charts if available.",
      "PART 3: Speaking and Writing Practice\n\nOral Practice:\nCall on individual learners to complete sentences orally.\n\nSay:\n\n'She _____ (wish)'\n\n'The dog _____ (bark)'\n\n'I _____ (read)'\n\n'They _____ (try)'\n\nLet each learner respond with the correct verb form.\n\nWriting Practice (Board):\nWrite 3 incomplete sentences on the board and ask the class to write them correctly in their books.\n\nExample:\n\n1. The fox _____ (chase) the rabbit.\n\n2. We _____ (watch) a movie.\n\n3. She _____ (carry) the books.\n\nDiscuss answers together.",
      "PART 4: Sentence Building Activity\n\nNow challenge the learners to create their own sentences using the correct present tense verb forms.\n\nInstructions:\n\nWrite 3 sentences on your own.\n\nUse different types of subjects: one singular, one plural, one with “I” or “you.”\n\nExample model:\n\nShe wishes to go home.\n\nThe birds fly high.\n\nI like apples.\n\nWalk around the classroom and support learners.",
      "PART 5: Exercise (Individual Work)\n\nInstructions: Fill in the blanks with the correct form of the verb in present tense.\n\n1. He ______ (kiss) his mother.\n\n2. The boys ______ (run) fast.\n\n3. You ______ (fix) the table.\n\n4. She ______ (carry) her bag.\n\n5. I ______ (watch) cartoons.\n\n6. It ______ (buzz) loudly.\n\n7. They ______ (wash) their hands.\n\n8. The child ______ (cry) for sweets.\n\n9. We ______ (wish) for rain.\n\n10.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Verb Agreement</b>:<br><br>In English, verbs need to match or 'agree' with the subject of the sentence. This means the verb changes based on whether we are talking about I, he, she, it, we, you, or they. In today's lesson, we will focus on the special verbs be, do, and have and how they change in both the present and past tenses to match the subject of the sentence.<br><br>Discussion: Ask students to identify the verb in a simple sentence and how it agrees with the subject.",
      
      "<b>Part 2: Agreement in the Present Tense</b>:<br><br>1. <b>Be</b>:<br>I → am<br>he, she, it → is<br>we, you, they → are<br><br>Examples:<br>I am happy.<br>She is tired.<br>They are playing soccer.<br><br>2. <b>Do</b>:<br>I, we, you, they → do<br>he, she, it → does<br><br>Examples:<br>I do my homework.<br>He does his chores.<br>They do their work together.<br><br>3. <b>Have</b>:<br>I, we, you, they → have<br>he, she, it → has<br><br>Examples:<br>I have a cat.<br>She has a pencil.<br>We have a big house.<br><br>Class Exercise: Ask students to give their own examples for each verb.",
      
      "<b>Part 3: Agreement in the Past Tense</b>:<br><br>In the past tense, only the verb be changes depending on the subject. The verbs do and have stay the same (both become did and had, respectively) no matter the subject.<br><br>1. <b>Be</b>:<br>I, he, she, it → was<br>we, you, they → were<br><br>Examples:<br>I was at the park yesterday.<br>She was at school last week.<br>They were at the party.<br><br>2. <b>Do</b>:<br>I, he, she, it, we, you, they → did (same for all subjects)<br><br>Examples:<br>I did my homework.<br>He did not go to the store.<br>They did their work.<br><br>3. <b>Have</b>:<br>I, he, she, it, we, you, they → had (same for all subjects)<br><br>Examples:<br>I had lunch at noon.<br>She had a great day yesterday.<br>They had a fun time at the beach.<br><br>Group Activity: Ask students to convert present tense sentences into past tense.",
      
      "<b>Part 4: Why Agreement is Important</b>:<br><br>Agreement is important because it helps the sentence make sense and sound correct. Without matching the subject and the verb, the sentence can sound awkward or wrong. For example:<br><br>Incorrect: She have a dog. (Should be: She has a dog.)<br><br>Correct: They are playing outside.<br><br>Discussion: Discuss why incorrect subject-verb agreement can make sentences confusing or unclear.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Linking Verbs</b>:<br><br>What is a linking verb?<br>A linking verb connects the subject of a sentence to a noun or an adjective in the predicate. It does not show action but helps to describe or explain something about the subject.<br>For example, in the sentence 'The house is big and roomy,' the verb 'is' links the subject (the house) to the adjective (big and roomy).",
      "<b>Part 2: The Verb 'Be' as a Linking Verb</b>:<br><br>The verb 'be' is one of the most common linking verbs. It has special forms in the present tense:<br><br>I am (e.g., 'I am part of a big family.')<br>You are (e.g., 'You are helpful.')<br>He/She/It is (e.g., 'The dog is happy.')<br>We are (e.g., 'We are excited.')<br>They are (e.g., 'They are here.')<br><br>Explanation:<br>The verb 'be' links the subject to a description or identification of the subject. It is always followed by an adjective or noun.",
      "<b>Part 3: Examples of Linking Verbs in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Example 1:<br>'I am part of a big family.'<br>In this example, 'am' links 'I' to 'part of a big family,' which is a noun phrase describing 'I.'<br><br>Example 2:<br>'The house is big and roomy.'<br>Here, 'is' links the subject 'the house' to the adjectives 'big and roomy,' describing the house.<br><br>Example 3:<br>'All my brothers are here.'<br>In this sentence, 'are' links 'all my brothers' to the location 'here.'",
      "<b>Part 4: More About Linking Verbs</b>:<br><br>Linking verbs other than 'be':<br>While 'be' is the most common linking verb, there are other linking verbs, such as seem, appear, feel, become, and look.<br>Example with 'seem': 'The cake seems delicious.'<br>Example with 'feel': 'The pillow feels soft.'<br><br>How to identify linking verbs:<br>If a verb can be replaced with 'is' or 'am' and the sentence still makes sense, it is a linking verb.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>Read the sentences below. Identify the linking verb and underline it. After that, decide if the verb is linking to a noun or an adjective.<br><br>1. The sky is blue.<br>2. She feels excited about the trip.<br>3. The dog is friendly.<br>4. The weather seems cold today.<br>5. We are ready for the test.<br><br>After identifying the linking verbs:<br>Write a new sentence using a linking verb of your choice.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Main Verbs</b>:<br><br>A main verb is the word in a sentence that shows what the subject is doing or what is happening to the subject. It tells us the action. For example:<br><br>He visited the bay.<br>In this sentence, visited is the main verb because it tells what he did.<br><br>The dog barked loudly.<br>Here, barked is the main verb because it shows what the dog did.<br><br>A main verb can describe physical actions, such as run, jump, or eat, or it can describe states of being, like is, are, or was.",
      "<b>Part 2: Introduction to Helping Verbs</b>:<br><br>A helping verb works with the main verb to express a time or mood. Helping verbs help the main verb by giving more information about the action or condition. Some common helping verbs include have, has, had, am, is, are, was, were.<br><br>For example:<br>The class has visited the bay.<br>In this sentence, has is the helping verb and visited is the main verb. Has helps show that the action (visiting the bay) happened in the past.<br><br>They had learned about Spartina.<br>Here, had is the helping verb and learned is the main verb. Had helps show that the learning happened before something else.<br><br>I have looked for it in the water.<br>Have is the helping verb and looked is the main verb. Have shows that the action of looking happened in the past.",
      "<b>Part 3: Difference Between Main Verbs and Helping Verbs</b>:<br><br>Main verbs: The main verb is the central word that expresses the primary action or state in the sentence. It tells us what the subject is doing or experiencing.<br><br>Helping verbs: Helping verbs assist the main verb by showing tense or mood. They don't show action by themselves but help to form the complete verb phrase.<br><br>Let’s break this down with some examples:<br>She is reading a book.<br>Main verb: reading<br>Helping verb: is<br>The helping verb is shows that the action of reading is happening right now.<br><br>They were playing outside.<br>Main verb: playing<br>Helping verb: were<br>Were tells us the action was happening in the past.",
      "<b>Part 4: How Helping Verbs and Main Verbs Work Together</b>:<br><br>When a helping verb is added to a main verb, they work together to create different meanings. The combination helps to show when the action took place or how it happened.<br><br>For example:<br>I am eating breakfast.<br>Main verb: eating<br>Helping verb: am<br>This tells us that eating is happening at the moment.<br><br>She has finished her homework.<br>Main verb: finished<br>Helping verb: has<br>The use of has shows that the homework was finished at some point before now.<br><br>By adding different helping verbs, we can change the meaning and time of the main verb.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Identifying Main and Helping Verbs</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read each sentence carefully. Identify the main verb and the helping verb in each one. Write the main verb and the helping verb on the lines provided.<br><br>1. She has completed her project.<br>Main verb: ___________<br>Helping verb: ___________<br><br>2.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Quotation marks are punctuation marks used to show when someone is speaking or when you are using someone else's exact words. They are placed at the beginning and end of the words spoken.<br><br>Example:<br>'I love reading books,' said Anna. Here, the words I love reading books are the exact words spoken by Anna, and they are placed within quotation marks.",
      "<b>Part 2: How to Use Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Quotation marks are always placed around the exact words a person says or the exact text you want to include from another source.<br><br>Example 1:<br>She said, 'I am going to the store.' The quotation marks go around the exact words 'I am going to the store.' spoken by the person.<br><br>Example 2:<br>'Let's play outside,' suggested Tom. Here, 'Let's play outside' is the direct quote, and the quotation marks show exactly what Tom said.",
      "<b>Part 3: Rules for Using Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Quotation marks are used to begin and end the exact words someone says. The punctuation (like commas or periods) that comes at the end of the quote goes inside the quotation marks.<br><br>Example: 'I will be back soon,' he said.<br><br>If a question or exclamation is part of the quote, place the question mark or exclamation mark inside the quotation marks.<br><br>Example: 'Are you coming?' she asked.<br><br>Example: 'Wow!' he exclaimed.",
      "<b>Part 4: Common Mistakes to Avoid</b>:<br><br>Don't forget to use both quotation marks. You need to have one at the beginning and one at the end of the words being spoken.<br><br>Incorrect: She said 'I like pizza.<br>Correct: She said, 'I like pizza.'<br><br>When quoting, always make sure to include exact words. Don’t change what someone said if you are quoting them directly.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Using Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read each sentence below. Correctly add the quotation marks around the spoken words.<br><br>1. Sarah asked, What time is the party?<br>2. John said I am going to the park later.<br>3. He shouted, Watch out!<br>4. She said, Can I borrow your pencil?<br>5. They asked, Where did you go on vacation?"
