      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Fill in the blanks with commas)</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Complete the sentences by adding commas where needed.<br><br>1. We have apples oranges bananas and grapes.<br>2. She can sing dance and act.<br>3. My friends are Tom Jane and Sam.<br>4. You can choose a red shirt a blue shirt or a green shirt.<br>5.

If the verb ends in a short vowel and consonant, we double the consonant:<br>hop → hopped<br>clap → clapped<br><br><b>Tip:</b> Not all words follow the same rule.
