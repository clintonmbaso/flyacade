      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Action Verbs</b>:<br><br>An action verb tells us what the subject does or did. It's a word that shows action, such as run, jump, eat, or sing.<br><br>Example:<br>\"Tom runs fast.\"<br>\"Sara sings beautifully.\"<br>In both examples, the verbs \"runs\" and \"sings\" tell us what Tom and Sara are doing.",
      "<b>Part 2: Present Tense Verbs</b>:<br><br>The present tense of a verb tells what happens now or regularly. It shows actions that are happening in the present moment.<br>Examples:<br>\"I eat lunch every day.\" (This shows an action happening regularly.)<br>\"She reads a book now.\" (This shows an action happening at the present moment.)<br>We use the present tense when the action is happening at the moment or happens regularly.",
      "<b>Part 3: Subject-Verb Agreement in the Present Tense</b>:<br><br>The present-tense verb must agree with the subject.<br><br>Singular subject: Add -s to most verbs (he, she, it).<br>Example: \"She plays soccer.\" (The verb \"play\" becomes \"plays\" for the singular subject \"she.\")<br><br>Plural subject: Do not add -s to the verb (they, we, I, you).<br>Example: \"They play soccer.\" (The verb \"play\" stays the same for the plural subject \"they.\")<br><br>Special case: For \"I\" and \"you,\" the verb does not change.<br>Example: \"I eat breakfast.\"<br>Example: \"You run fast.\"",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Identifying and Correcting Present Tense Verbs</b>:<br><br>Let's look at some sentences together and decide whether the subject and verb agree in the present tense.<br>\"She play the piano.\" (Incorrect – the subject \"She\" is singular, so the verb should be \"plays.\")<br>\"They runs fast.\" (Incorrect – the subject \"They\" is plural, so the verb should be \"run.\")<br>\"I dances in the morning.\" (Incorrect – \"I\" does not require adding -s to the verb, so it should be \"dance.\")",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>1. Correct the following sentences:<br>\"He swim every day.\"<br>\"We eats lunch at school.\"<br>\"You sings loudly.\"<br>\"They is playing outside.\"<br><br>2. Write 5 sentences using the correct subject-verb agreement:<br>Example: \"I walk to school.\"<br>Try using he, she, they, and I as subjects. Make sure the verb agrees with the subject!"

Example: \"He plays soccer.\"",
      "<b>Part 3: Subject-Verb Agreement with Plural Subjects</b>:<br><br>For plural subjects (they, we, you) or when the subject is I or you, we do not add -s or -es to the verb.<br><br>Example:<br>\"They watch TV every evening.\" (The subject \"They\" is plural, so we use \"watch\" without adding -es.)<br>\"I carry the box.\" (The subject \"I\" does not require -s or -es.)<br>\"You fly to school.\" (The subject \"you\" does not require -s or -es.)",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Objective: To understand the purpose of quotation marks and when to use them.<br><br>Explanation: Quotation marks are used to show the exact words spoken by someone. They come in pairs: one at the beginning and one at the end of the speaker's words.<br><br>Example: <i>\"I am going to the store,\" said Tom.</i><br>In this example, the words \"I am going to the store\" are the exact words spoken by Tom. Quotation marks are used around these words.",
      "<b>Part 2: Beginning a Quotation with a Capital Letter</b>:<br><br>Objective: To practice capitalizing the first letter of the quotation.<br><br>Explanation: When we begin a quotation, the first word of the quoted sentence should always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a larger sentence.<br><br>Example: <i>\"I love reading,\" she said.</i><br>Here, the quoted words \"I love reading\" start with a capital I, as it is the beginning of the speaker's sentence.<br><br>Incorrect Example: <i>\"i love reading,\" she said.</i> (The i should be capitalized to I.)",
      "<b>Part 3: Not Using Quotation Marks for Paraphrasing</b>:<br><br>Objective: To understand when not to use quotation marks.<br><br>Explanation: Quotation marks are only used when you are reporting someone's exact words. If you are just retelling or summarizing what someone said (paraphrasing), do not use quotation marks.<br><br>Example (with quotation marks): <i>Tom said, \"I will meet you at the park at 3 PM.\"</i><br><br>Example (without quotation marks): <i>Tom said he would meet us at the park at 3 PM.</i> (This is paraphrasing, so no quotation marks are needed.)",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Identifying and Using Quotation Marks</b>:<br><br>Objective: To practice using quotation marks correctly in sentences.<br><br>Explanation: Let's look at some examples together and decide whether quotation marks are needed or not.<br><br><i>\"She said I am going to the library.\"</i> (Incorrect – The sentence is not using the exact words of the speaker, so it should be paraphrased without quotation marks: She said she was going to the library.)<br><br><i>\"I love going to the beach,\" he smiled.</i> (Correct – The exact words of the speaker are used, so we need quotation marks.)<br><br><i>\"Can you help me with my homework?\" asked Mary.</i> (Correct – The exact question spoken by Mary is enclosed in quotation marks.)",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Objective: To apply knowledge of quotation marks and capitalization in sentences.<br><br>1. Correct the following sentences by adding quotation marks and capitalizing correctly:<br>tom said i want to go to the park.<br>she asked what time is it?<br>john replied i will finish my homework later.<br>do you like pizza he asked.<br><br>2.

Singular subjects (he, she, it, or any one thing) usually require an -s at the end of the verb. Example: He walks to school. She reads a book.<br><br>2.

(The action is complete in the present.)<br>I am going to the store. (The action is happening now.)<br>Past tense:<br>They had left before the rain started.

    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Linking Verbs</b>:<br><br>A linking verb is a special type of verb that does not show action. Instead, it connects the subject of a sentence to more information about the subject, such as a description, condition, or state. Linking verbs act as a bridge between the subject and the predicate (the part of the sentence that tells us more about the subject).<br><br>For example:<br>The sky is blue.<br>She is a teacher.<br><br>In both sentences, the linking verb “is” connects the subject (sky, she) to more information (blue, teacher). The action of “being” is implied, not shown.",
      "<b>Part 2: Common Linking Verbs</b>:<br><br>The most common linking verbs are forms of the verb “to be”. These include:<br>is, am, are, was, were<br><br>Let’s look at some examples of how these linking verbs are used:<br>I am happy today.<br>They are students.<br>He was tired yesterday.<br>We were at the park.<br><br>These linking verbs show the state or condition of the subject but do not describe any action.",
      "<b>Part 3: How Linking Verbs Differ from Action Verbs</b>:<br><br>It’s important to understand that linking verbs are different from action verbs. Action verbs show what the subject is doing, while linking verbs connect the subject to additional information.<br><br>For example:<br>She runs fast. (action verb, shows what she is doing)<br>She is fast. (linking verb, describes her condition)<br><br>Here, “runs” shows action, while “is” connects the subject to the adjective “fast,” which describes the subject.",
      "<b>Part 4: Identifying Linking Verbs in Sentences</b>:<br><br>To identify a linking verb in a sentence, look for a verb that connects the subject with a description, condition, or state, but does not show an action.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Playwriting</b>:<br><br>In this lesson, we are going to learn how to write dialogue for a play. Writing dialogue for a play is different from writing regular stories or essays. In a play, the characters speak their lines, and there are specific rules for how to write and present these lines.<br><br>Let’s go over some key rules for writing dialogue in a play.",
      "<b>Part 2: Using a Colon to Separate Character’s Name and Dialogue</b>:<br><br>In a play, we use a colon (:) to separate the character’s name from the words they are saying. This is a special rule that makes the dialogue clear and easy to read.<br><br>For example:<br><br>GEORGE: It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!<br><br>Here, GEORGE is the character, and after the colon, we can see his dialogue, “It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!”",
      "<b>Part 3: No Quotation Marks in a Play</b>:<br><br>Unlike in regular stories where we use quotation marks to show dialogue, in a play, we do not use quotation marks. The character’s name followed by a colon is enough to show that they are speaking. This keeps the format clean and easy to follow.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Correct: GEORGE: It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!<br>Incorrect: GEORGE: “It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!”<br><br>Notice there are no quotation marks around “It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!” in the correct example.",
      "<b>Part 4: Starting a New Line for Each New Speaker</b>:<br><br>Whenever a new character speaks, start a new line. This helps the audience or reader follow along and know who is talking at any given time. Each line of dialogue should belong to one character only.<br><br>For example:<br><br>GEORGE: It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!<br><br>MR. TAYLOR: Thank you, George. I’ve been looking for that book everywhere.<br><br>In this example, we can clearly see that George speaks first, then Mr. Taylor speaks on the next line.",
      "<b>Part 5: Using Parentheses for Stage Directions</b>:<br><br>Stage directions are instructions that tell the actors what to do or how to say their words. These directions are written in parentheses ( ). Stage directions help the actors understand the action and mood of a scene, like how they should stand, move, or express their emotions.<br><br>For example:<br><br>GEORGE (loudly): It’s right here, Mr. Taylor!<br>(George holds up the book.)<br><br>In this example, the stage direction tells us that George is speaking loudly and holding up the book while saying his line.",
      "<b>Part 6: Exercise – Writing Dialogue for a Play</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Now that you know the rules for writing dialogue in a play, let's practice! Write a short dialogue between two characters. Make sure to follow the rules:<br><br>1. Use a colon to separate the character’s name from their dialogue.<br>2. Don’t use quotation marks.<br>3. Start a new line each time a new character speaks.<br>4. Use parentheses for any stage directions.<br><br>Example:<br><br>LISA: I can't believe we are finally here!<br>TOM (excitedly): I know! Look at this view!<br>(They both look out over the mountains.)"

As we learned before, a linking verb does not show action; it connects the subject to the rest of the sentence. Some linking verbs connect the subject to a noun (like 'is' or 'was'), while others connect it to an adjective (like 'are' or 'were').<br><br>We also need to use proper punctuation in plays. Remember to:<br>1. Use a colon (:) after the character’s name.<br>2. Do not use quotation marks around dialogue.<br>3. Start a new line each time a new character speaks.<br>4. Use parentheses ( ) for stage directions.",
      "<b>Part 2: Identifying Errors in Linking Verbs and Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Here is the play excerpt with incorrect linking verbs and punctuation:<br><br>T.J. \"I need an idea for my social studies project.

      "<b>Part 3: Correcting the Errors</b>:<br><br>Now, let’s go over the corrections:<br><br>1. In the sentence 'My project are about Pawnee folktales,' the linking verb 'are' is incorrect. Since 'project' is singular, we should use 'is' instead of 'are.'<br>Corrected: CARA: 'My project is about Pawnee folktales.'<br><br>2. In the sentence 'The Plains tribes is very interesting to read about,' the linking verb 'is' is incorrect. 'Tribes' is plural, so we should use 'are' instead of 'is.'<br>Corrected: CARA: 'The Plains tribes are very interesting to read about.'<br><br>3. In the sentence 'This were a great idea,' the linking verb 'were' is incorrect. We should use 'was' because 'This' is singular.<br>Corrected: T.J.: 'This was a great idea.'",
      "<b>Part 4: Rewritten Play Dialogue</b>:<br><br>Now let’s rewrite the play correctly, using proper linking verbs and punctuation:<br><br>T.J.: \"I need an idea for my social studies project. I can’t think of anything.\"<br>(T.J. paces the room nervously.)<br>CARA: \"My project is about Pawnee folktales.\"<br>T.J.: \"That’s a good idea, Cara.\"<br>(CARA opens the book and points to a picture.)<br>CARA: \"The Plains tribes are very interesting to read about.\"<br>T.J. excitedly: \"This was a great idea.\"",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Correcting the Play Dialogue</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>Now it’s your turn! Below is another short play excerpt with incorrect linking verbs. Correct the linking verbs and punctuation. Remember to use the correct linking verb for the subject and follow the punctuation rules for a play.<br><br>JACK. \"I can’t find my backpack anywhere!\"<br>(JACK looks around the room.)<br>LUCY. \"It was under the table, Jack!\"<br>JACK: \"Oh! I should of looked there.\"<br>(JACK picks up the backpack from under the table.)<br>LUCY. \"I’m glad I could help.\"<br><br>Answer Key:<br>1. \"It was under the table, Jack!\" is correct as 'it' is singular.<br>2. \"I should of looked there\" should be corrected to 'I should have looked there', but no linking verb is involved here."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Pronouns</b>:<br><br>A pronoun is a word that is used to replace a noun. Instead of repeating the same noun over and over in a sentence, we use pronouns to make sentences shorter and easier to understand.<br><br>Example:<br>Without a pronoun: Sara went to Sara’s house after Sara finished homework.<br>With a pronoun: Sara went to her house after she finished homework.<br><br>The word 'her' and 'she' are pronouns, replacing 'Sara'.",

      "<b>Part 4: Using Pronouns in Sentences</b>:<br><br>In sentences, pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition.

Instead of repeating the same nouns, we use pronouns to make sentences shorter and clearer.<br><br>Subject Pronouns:<br>Subject pronouns are used as the subject of a sentence. The subject is the person, animal, or thing that performs the action in a sentence.
