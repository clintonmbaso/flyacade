      "<b>Part 1: What is a Sentence?</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what is being said about the subject). For example:<br><br>The dog barks. Here, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'barks' is the predicate. Together, they form a complete thought.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you identify the subject and predicate in the sentence 'The dog barks'?",
      "<b>Part 2: What is a Sentence Fragment?</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject or a predicate, or it might not stand alone as a complete idea. For example:<br><br>Because it was raining. This is a fragment because it does not tell us the complete thought. We don't know what happened because it was raining.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Why do you think 'Because it was raining' is not a complete sentence?",
      "<b>Part 3: Capitalization in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Every sentence must begin with a capital letter. This is one of the rules of writing that helps us know where a new sentence starts. For example:<br><br>She went to the store. Notice that the first letter of the sentence, 'S,' is capitalized.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you think of other sentences that begin with a capital letter?",
      "<b>Part 4: End Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Most sentences end with a period. The period is a type of end punctuation. Other end punctuation marks can include a question mark (?) or an exclamation point (!), depending on the type of sentence:<br><br>She likes to read. (statement)<br>What time is it? (question)<br>Wow, that’s amazing! (exclamation)<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What punctuation mark would you use at the end of the sentence 'I like ice cream'?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Sentences and Fragments)</b>:<br><br>Read the following examples and determine if they are complete sentences or fragments.<br><br>1. The cat sleeps on the mat.<br>2. Jumped over the fence.<br>3. We went to the park.<br>4. After the rain stopped.<br>5. Can you help me with this?<br><br>Instructions: For each example, write 'Sentence' if it shows a complete thought, or 'Fragment' if it does not."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sentences</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. In English, sentences are made up of two main parts: the subject and the predicate.<br><br>Complete Subject: This part tells us what or whom the sentence is about.<br>Complete Predicate: This part tells us what the subject does or is. It can be one word or more than one word.<br><br>Example: The dog ran fast.<br>Complete Subject: The dog (tells us who the sentence is about)<br>Complete Predicate: ran fast (tells us what the dog did)",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding the Subject and Predicate</b>:<br><br>The Complete Subject is usually a noun or pronoun (like 'dog,' 'she,' 'the teacher').<br>The Complete Predicate includes the verb (action) and other words that tell us more about the action or state of the subject.<br><br>Example 1: Sentence: The cat jumped over the fence.<br>Complete Subject: The cat<br>Complete Predicate: jumped over the fence<br><br>Example 2: Sentence: Our teacher explains the lesson carefully.<br>Complete Subject: Our teacher<br>Complete Predicate: explains the lesson carefully",
      "<b>Part 3: Identifying Predicates in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Predicates can sometimes be more than one word. For example, the verb and any words that describe the action (like adjectives or adverbs) are all part of the predicate.<br><br>Example 1: Sentence: The boy played in the park.<br>Complete Subject: The boy<br>Complete Predicate: played in the park<br><br>Example 2: Sentence: She is reading a book in her room.<br>Complete Subject: She<br>Complete Predicate: is reading a book in her room",
      "<b>Part 4: Asking Sentences (Interrogative Sentences)</b>:<br><br>Asking sentences, also known as interrogative sentences, are used to ask questions. They follow the same rule of having a subject and a predicate, but they start with a question word (like who, what, where, why, or how) or with an auxiliary verb (like is, are, do, did).<br><br>Examples of Asking Sentences:<br>Who is your best friend?<br>Complete Subject: Who<br>Complete Predicate: is your best friend<br><br>Where did you go yesterday?<br>Complete Subject: You<br>Complete Predicate: did go yesterday<br><br>In asking sentences, the subject and predicate can sometimes be in a different order compared to statements.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Read the sentences below and identify the subject and predicate. Then, rewrite the sentences as questions.<br>1. The dog chased the ball.<br>2. She is reading a storybook.<br>3. The teacher explained the lesson.<br>4. The children played outside.<br>5.

They tell us what the dog and the teacher are doing.",

It tells us exactly what happened in more detail.",
      "<b>Part 3: Compound Predicates</b>:<br><br>A compound predicate happens when there are two actions or verbs joined by the word 'and' that tell us what the subject is doing. For example:<br><br>The boy ran and jumped.<br>Sarah read a book and wrote a letter.<br><br>In these examples, the subject (the boy and Sarah) is doing two things. These two actions are connected by 'and,' which makes the predicate compound.",
      "<b>Part 4: Using Compound Predicates in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Now that you understand what a compound predicate is, let's look at how you can create sentences with compound predicates. Remember, you need:<br><br>1. A subject (who or what the sentence is about).<br>2. Two actions connected by 'and.'<br><br>For example:<br><br>The dog barked and ran around.<br>The teacher taught and answered questions.<br><br>You can practice making your own sentences by following this pattern!",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Directions: Write sentences using compound predicates. Each sentence should have a subject and two actions connected by 'and.' Use the subjects provided, and think of two things they could do.<br><br>1. Write a sentence using the subject 'The cat'.<br>Example: The cat ________________ and ________________.<br><br>2. Write a sentence using the subject 'The children'.<br>Example: The children ________________ and ________________.<br><br>3. Write a sentence using the subject 'I'.<br>Example: I ________________ and ________________.<br><br>4.

Predicate: The predicate tells us what the subject does or what happens to the subject.<br><br>For example:<br><br>The dog (subject) barked loudly (predicate).<br><br>This is a complete sentence because it has both a subject and a predicate, and it expresses a full thought.",

A fragment usually misses either a subject or a predicate.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Fragment: Barked loudly.<br><br>This is a fragment because we don’t know who or what barked loudly.<br><br>To correct a fragment, we need to add either a subject or a predicate. For example:<br><br>Corrected: The dog barked loudly.",
      "<b>Part 3: Run-on Sentences</b>:<br><br>A run-on sentence happens when two sentences are joined together without proper punctuation or a connecting word. This creates a confusing or incorrect sentence.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Run-on: I went to the store I bought apples.<br><br>This is a run-on because two complete ideas are joined without punctuation.<br><br>To correct a run-on, you can either:<br><br>1. Add a period to separate the two ideas: I went to the store. I bought apples.<br>2. Use a conjunction (like 'and' or 'but') to connect the two ideas: I went to the store, and I bought apples.",

I will show you a sentence, and we will decide together if it is a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on.<br><br>1. The cat jumped on the chair. (Complete sentence)<br>2. Jumped on the chair. (Fragment – missing a subject)<br>3. I love ice cream I eat it every day. (Run-on – needs separation or conjunction)",
