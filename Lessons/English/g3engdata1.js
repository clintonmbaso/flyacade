      "<b>Part 1: What is a Sentence?</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what is being said about the subject). For example:<br><br>The dog barks. Here, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'barks' is the predicate. Together, they form a complete thought.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you identify the subject and predicate in the sentence 'The dog barks'?",
      "<b>Part 2: What is a Sentence Fragment?</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject or a predicate, or it might not stand alone as a complete idea. For example:<br><br>Because it was raining. This is a fragment because it does not tell us the complete thought. We don't know what happened because it was raining.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Why do you think 'Because it was raining' is not a complete sentence?",
      "<b>Part 3: Capitalization in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Every sentence must begin with a capital letter. This is one of the rules of writing that helps us know where a new sentence starts. For example:<br><br>She went to the store. Notice that the first letter of the sentence, 'S,' is capitalized.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you think of other sentences that begin with a capital letter?",
      "<b>Part 4: End Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Most sentences end with a period. The period is a type of end punctuation. Other end punctuation marks can include a question mark (?) or an exclamation point (!), depending on the type of sentence:<br><br>She likes to read. (statement)<br>What time is it? (question)<br>Wow, that’s amazing! (exclamation)<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What punctuation mark would you use at the end of the sentence 'I like ice cream'?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Sentences and Fragments)</b>:<br><br>Read the following examples and determine if they are complete sentences or fragments.<br><br>1. The cat sleeps on the mat.<br>2. Jumped over the fence.<br>3. We went to the park.<br>4. After the rain stopped.<br>5. Can you help me with this?<br><br>Instructions: For each example, write 'Sentence' if it shows a complete thought, or 'Fragment' if it does not."
