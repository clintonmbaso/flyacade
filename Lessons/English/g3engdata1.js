      "<b>Part 1: What is a Sentence?</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what is being said about the subject). For example:<br><br>The dog barks. Here, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'barks' is the predicate. Together, they form a complete thought.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you identify the subject and predicate in the sentence 'The dog barks'?",
      "<b>Part 2: What is a Sentence Fragment?</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject or a predicate, or it might not stand alone as a complete idea. For example:<br><br>Because it was raining. This is a fragment because it does not tell us the complete thought. We don't know what happened because it was raining.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Why do you think 'Because it was raining' is not a complete sentence?",
      "<b>Part 3: Capitalization in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Every sentence must begin with a capital letter. This is one of the rules of writing that helps us know where a new sentence starts. For example:<br><br>She went to the store. Notice that the first letter of the sentence, 'S,' is capitalized.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you think of other sentences that begin with a capital letter?",
      "<b>Part 4: End Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Most sentences end with a period. The period is a type of end punctuation. Other end punctuation marks can include a question mark (?) or an exclamation point (!), depending on the type of sentence:<br><br>She likes to read. (statement)<br>What time is it? (question)<br>Wow, that’s amazing! (exclamation)<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What punctuation mark would you use at the end of the sentence 'I like ice cream'?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Sentences and Fragments)</b>:<br><br>Read the following examples and determine if they are complete sentences or fragments.<br><br>1. The cat sleeps on the mat.<br>2. Jumped over the fence.<br>3. We went to the park.<br>4. After the rain stopped.<br>5. Can you help me with this?<br><br>Instructions: For each example, write 'Sentence' if it shows a complete thought, or 'Fragment' if it does not."

In English, sentences are made up of two main parts: the subject and the predicate.<br><br>Complete Subject: This part tells us what or whom the sentence is about.<br>Complete Predicate: This part tells us what the subject does or is. It can be one word or more than one word.<br><br>Example: The dog ran fast.<br>Complete Subject: The dog (tells us who the sentence is about)<br>Complete Predicate: ran fast (tells us what the dog did)",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding the Subject and Predicate</b>:<br><br>The Complete Subject is usually a noun or pronoun (like 'dog,' 'she,' 'the teacher').<br>The Complete Predicate includes the verb (action) and other words that tell us more about the action or state of the subject.<br><br>Example 1: Sentence: The cat jumped over the fence.<br>Complete Subject: The cat<br>Complete Predicate: jumped over the fence<br><br>Example 2: Sentence: Our teacher explains the lesson carefully.<br>Complete Subject: Our teacher<br>Complete Predicate: explains the lesson carefully",
      "<b>Part 3: Identifying Predicates in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Predicates can sometimes be more than one word. For example, the verb and any words that describe the action (like adjectives or adverbs) are all part of the predicate.<br><br>Example 1: Sentence: The boy played in the park.<br>Complete Subject: The boy<br>Complete Predicate: played in the park<br><br>Example 2: Sentence: She is reading a book in her room.<br>Complete Subject: She<br>Complete Predicate: is reading a book in her room",
      "<b>Part 4: Asking Sentences (Interrogative Sentences)</b>:<br><br>Asking sentences, also known as interrogative sentences, are used to ask questions. They follow the same rule of having a subject and a predicate, but they start with a question word (like who, what, where, why, or how) or with an auxiliary verb (like is, are, do, did).<br><br>Examples of Asking Sentences:<br>Who is your best friend?<br>Complete Subject: Who<br>Complete Predicate: is your best friend<br><br>Where did you go yesterday?<br>Complete Subject: You<br>Complete Predicate: did go yesterday<br><br>In asking sentences, the subject and predicate can sometimes be in a different order compared to statements.",

      "<b>Part 3: Run-on Sentences</b>:<br><br>A run-on sentence happens when two sentences are joined together without proper punctuation or a connecting word.

Here's how we use them for nouns:<br><br><b>Common nouns:</b> These are written in lowercase unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence. Example: I saw a dog at the park.<br><br><b>Proper nouns:</b> These always begin with capital letters, even if they are in the middle of a sentence. Example: I visited New York last summer.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Irregular Plural Nouns</b>:<br><br>In the English language, most plural nouns are formed by simply adding an -s or -es at the end. For example, the plural of cat is cats, and the plural of box is boxes. However, some nouns have irregular plural forms, meaning they don't follow the usual rules. These nouns change in a special way when they become plural.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>The plural of man is men.<br>The plural of woman is women.<br>The plural of child is children.<br>The plural of mouse is mice.<br><br>It's important to recognize these irregular plurals, as they don't follow the typical pattern!",

These nouns are singular in form but represent more than one thing as a whole. Collective nouns can refer to groups of things that are considered as one unit.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>A flock of birds<br>A team of players<br>A family of people<br>A herd of cows<br>A class of students<br><br>Even though collective nouns refer to a group, they are treated as singular when used in a sentence.",

They don’t follow the regular rules of adding -s or -es to make the plural.<br>Examples: men, women, mice, children.<br><br>Collective Nouns:<br>These are nouns that name a group of people, animals, or things. They are singular in form but refer to a collection of things.<br>Examples: team, flock, family, class.<br><br>Quick Tip:<br>Irregular plural nouns describe changes to individual nouns (e.g., one mouse becomes many mice). Collective nouns, however, describe groups or collections of things or people.",

(Expected answers: add -s or -es).<br>Explain: 'Some words don’t follow these rules. These are called irregular plural nouns.'<br>'For example, we say one sheep and many sheep — not sheeps!'<br>Use simple sentences to show how irregular plurals work:<br><br>I saw one deer in the forest.<br>Yesterday, I saw five deer in the forest.",

      "<b>Part 1: Comma in Dates</b>:<br><br>When writing a date, use a comma between the day and the year.<br>Example:<br>Correct: 'I was born on May 15, 2012.'<br>Incorrect: 'I was born on May 15 2012.'<br><br>Why it's important: Commas help to separate parts of the date, making it easier to read and understand.",
      "<b>Part 2: Comma in Addresses</b>:<br><br>Use a comma between the name of a city or town and the state or country. Also, use commas to separate different parts of an address, such as street, town, and state.<br>Example:<br>Correct: 'I live in Springfield, Ohio, on Maple Street.'<br>Incorrect: 'I live in Springfield Ohio on Maple Street.'<br><br>Why it's important: Commas clarify where a person lives, and help distinguish between different parts of the address.",
      "<b>Part 3: Comma in a Series</b>:<br><br>Use commas to separate three or more items in a list or series. Do not place a comma after the last item.<br>Example:<br>Correct: 'I like apples, bananas, oranges, and grapes.'<br>Incorrect: 'I like apples, bananas, oranges, and, grapes.'<br><br>Why it's important: Commas make the items in a list clear and easy to read.",
      "<b>Part 4: Comma with Direct Address</b>:<br><br>Use a comma after the name of a person being spoken to. Also, use commas after words like 'yes' or 'no' when they are used at the beginning of a sentence.<br>Examples:<br>'Sarah, can you help me?'<br>'Yes, I would like to go.'<br>'No, I do not have the answer.'<br><br>Why it's important: Commas help separate the person being addressed from the rest of the sentence and show that you are speaking directly to someone.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Read the sentences below and add the correct commas where needed:<br>1. I live in Miami Florida on Ocean Drive.<br>2. On April 10 2020, we went on a family trip.<br>3. My favorite colors are red blue and green.<br>4. John do you have the book I asked for?<br>5. Yes I will go to the store later.<br>6. The concert will be in New York New York on Main Street.<br>7. Look at that car Sarah it’s amazing!<br>8.
