      "<b>Part 1: What is a Sentence?</b>:<br><br>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It must contain a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what is being said about the subject). For example:<br><br>The dog barks. Here, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'barks' is the predicate. Together, they form a complete thought.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you identify the subject and predicate in the sentence 'The dog barks'?",
      "<b>Part 2: What is a Sentence Fragment?</b>:<br><br>A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may be missing a subject or a predicate, or it might not stand alone as a complete idea. For example:<br><br>Because it was raining. This is a fragment because it does not tell us the complete thought. We don't know what happened because it was raining.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Why do you think 'Because it was raining' is not a complete sentence?",
      "<b>Part 3: Capitalization in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Every sentence must begin with a capital letter. This is one of the rules of writing that helps us know where a new sentence starts. For example:<br><br>She went to the store. Notice that the first letter of the sentence, 'S,' is capitalized.<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: Can you think of other sentences that begin with a capital letter?",
      "<b>Part 4: End Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Most sentences end with a period. The period is a type of end punctuation. Other end punctuation marks can include a question mark (?) or an exclamation point (!), depending on the type of sentence:<br><br>She likes to read. (statement)<br>What time is it? (question)<br>Wow, that’s amazing! (exclamation)<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What punctuation mark would you use at the end of the sentence 'I like ice cream'?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Identifying Sentences and Fragments)</b>:<br><br>Read the following examples and determine if they are complete sentences or fragments.<br><br>1. The cat sleeps on the mat.<br>2. Jumped over the fence.<br>3. We went to the park.<br>4. After the rain stopped.<br>5. Can you help me with this?<br><br>Instructions: For each example, write 'Sentence' if it shows a complete thought, or 'Fragment' if it does not."

      "<b>Part 3: How to Recognize a Statement or a Question</b>:<br><br>A statement does not ask anything, it simply shares information.<br>A question, on the other hand, is asking for information, and you can usually identify it by looking for a question mark at the end.<br><br>Examples:<br>Statement: \"The dog is barking.\"<br>Question: \"Is the dog barking?\"<br><br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: How can you tell if a sentence is a statement or a question?",
      "<b>Part 4: Class Exercise – Identifying Statements and Questions</b>:<br><br>Read the sentences below and decide if they are statements or questions. Write S for statement or Q for question.<br>1. What time is it? ______<br>2. The sun rises in the east. ______<br>3. Do you like swimming? ______<br>4. I have a pet cat. ______<br>5.

      "<b>Part 5: Recap and Class Discussion</b>:<br><br>Review the key points learned in the lesson: statements give information and end with a period, while questions ask for information and end with a question mark.<br>Discussion:<br>Ask students: What is one thing you learned about statements and questions today?

      "<b>Part 4: Punctuation</b>:<br><br>Students will learn the importance of punctuation, particularly the use of question marks at the end of questions. For example, 'will you help out with the bake sale this year' should be written as 'Will you help out with the bake sale this year?'. Students will practice adding punctuation to sentences.<br><br>Examples for punctuation correction:<br>4. we are going to a soccer game after school.<br>5. will you help out with the bake sale this year?",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (5 Questions)</b>:<br><br>Students will complete an exercise where they identify whether a sentence is a statement or a question. They will also correct the punctuation and capitalization of the sentences provided.<br><br>Examples for the exercise:<br>1. she enjoys reading books in the library<br>2. are we going to the park tomorrow<br>3. the sun is shining brightly today<br>4. do you like playing sports<br>5. he finished his homework before dinner"
