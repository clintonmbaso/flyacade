      "<b>Part 1: Introduction – What Are Parts of Speech?</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To recall and understand that words in English are grouped into categories called parts of speech, each serving a specific role in a sentence.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>In English, words are organized based on how they are used in a sentence. These categories are called parts of speech. There are eight main parts of speech:<br><br>1. Noun – Names a person, place, thing, or idea.<br>Examples: teacher, school, pencil, happiness<br><br>2. Pronoun – Replaces a noun.<br>Examples: he, she, it, they<br><br>3. Verb – Shows an action or state of being.<br>Examples: run, jump, is, are<br><br>4. Adjective – Describes a noun.<br>Examples: red, tall, quick, kind<br><br>5. Adverb – Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb.<br>Examples: quickly, very, silently<br><br>6. Preposition – Shows the relationship between a noun/pronoun and another word.<br>Examples: on, under, beside, with<br><br>7. Conjunction – Connects words or groups of words.<br>Examples: and, but, or, because<br><br>8. Interjection – Expresses a strong feeling or emotion.<br>Examples: Wow!, Oh!, Ouch!",
      "<b>Part 2: Deep Dive – Examples in Sentences</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To see how each part of speech functions within a sentence.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> Identify and label the parts of speech in these sentences:<br><br>1. The dog (noun) ran (verb) quickly (adverb) across (preposition) the yard.<br><br>2. She (pronoun) wore a beautiful (adjective) dress.<br><br>3. I wanted to go to the park, but (conjunction) it started raining.<br><br>4. Wow! (interjection) That was amazing!<br><br><b>Teacher Tip:</b><br>Use flashcards or write these examples on the board. Ask students to come up and underline or circle the different parts of speech.",
      "<b>Part 3: Why Are Parts of Speech Important?</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To understand how knowledge of parts of speech helps improve reading, writing, and speaking skills.<br><br><b>Discussion Points:</b><br>Knowing the parts of speech helps you construct better sentences.<br>It helps when learning new vocabulary because you understand how words function.<br>When writing stories or essays, using adjectives and adverbs helps make your writing more interesting.<br>Understanding verbs and subjects helps avoid grammatical errors.<br><br><b>Class Discussion Prompt:</b><br>'Why do you think it's important to know what type of word you're using?'<br>Encourage learners to share examples where they used descriptive words in their writing or spoke clearly using a variety of sentence types.",
      "<b>Part 4: Mini Practice with the Class</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To review and reinforce recognition of parts of speech through a fun, interactive group activity.<br><br><b>Activity: Parts of Speech Bingo or Matching Game</b><br><br><b>Option A: Bingo</b><br>Create bingo cards with words that are nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Call out the part of speech and students cover the correct word.<br><br><b>Option B: Matching Game</b><br>Prepare cards—some with words and others with part of speech labels. Students must match them correctly.<br><br><b>Words to Include:</b><br>cat (noun)<br>beautiful (adjective)<br>jump (verb)<br>quickly (adverb)<br>under (preposition)<br>he (pronoun)<br>and (conjunction)<br>wow (interjection)",
      "<b>Part 5: Individual Exercise</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To assess student understanding of parts of speech.<br><br><b>Instructions:</b><br>Write the sentence. Then underline and label each word with its part of speech.<br><br><b>Exercise A: Identify the Parts of Speech in Each Sentence</b><br>1. The small boy kicked the ball.<br>2. We laughed loudly at the joke.<br>3. Oh! That movie was exciting.<br>4. Sarah and Tim went to the zoo.<br>5.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Paragraphs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Understand what a paragraph is and its purpose in writing.<br><br>Explanation:<br>A paragraph is a group of sentences that talk about one main idea.<br>Each paragraph should be organized clearly to help the reader understand the message.<br>Paragraphs make writing easier to read and more interesting.<br><br>Example:<br><i>Paragraphs are like building blocks in writing. Each block has one main idea. When we put several well-built paragraphs together, we create clear and organized writing.</i><br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Ask learners: Why do we need paragraphs in writing?<br>Discuss how writing looks without paragraph breaks.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Topic Sentence</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to identify and write topic sentences.<br><br>Explanation:<br>The topic sentence tells the reader what the paragraph is about.<br>It is usually the first sentence in the paragraph.<br>A strong topic sentence is clear, specific, and introduces the main idea.<br><br>Example:<br><i>Dogs are one of the most loyal pets a person can have.</i><br>This sentence tells the reader that the paragraph will be about dogs and their loyalty.<br><br>Activity:<br>Read three sample sentences and ask learners to pick which one is a topic sentence.<br>Have students create their own topic sentence based on a picture or word prompt (e.g., “school,” “rainy day,” “soccer”).",
      "<b>Part 3: Supporting Details</b>:<br><br>Objective: Understand how to add supporting details to a topic sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>Supporting details are sentences that explain, describe, or give examples related to the topic sentence.<br>They help the reader understand the main idea more deeply.<br><br>Example (Continuing from above):<br><i>Dogs will protect their owners even when in danger. They are always happy to see you when you come home. They can be trained to do many helpful things.</i><br><br>Teaching Tip:<br>Remind learners: If the topic sentence is the “main idea,” supporting details are the “evidence” or “reasons.”<br><br>Activity:<br>Give learners a topic sentence. Ask them to write 2–3 supporting details.<br>Share examples together.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Concluding Sentence</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to write a good concluding sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>A concluding sentence comes at the end of the paragraph.<br>It wraps up the paragraph and reminds the reader of the main idea.<br>It can restate the topic or give a final thought.<br><br>Example:<br><i>That’s why dogs are called a person’s best friend.</i><br><br>Tips:<br>Use phrases like “In conclusion,” “That’s why,” “So you can see,” or “To sum up.”<br><br>Practice Together:<br>Look at short paragraphs and underline the concluding sentence.<br>Try writing a concluding sentence for a paragraph with only a topic and supporting details.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercises</b>:<br><br>Objective: Apply knowledge of paragraph structure.<br><br>Exercise 1: Identify the parts<br>Read this paragraph and label the topic sentence, supporting details, and concluding sentence.<br><i>Plants need sunlight to grow. They use sunlight to make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Without sunlight, most plants would die. That is why gardeners always make sure their plants are in sunny places.</i><br><br>Exercise 2: Fill in the blanks<br>Below is a paragraph with missing parts. Fill in the missing sentences:<br><br>Topic Sentence:<br><br>Supporting Detail 1: Elephants use their trunks to pick up food.<br>Supporting Detail 2: They also use it to drink water and take a bath.<br>Concluding Sentence: ___<br><br>Exercise 3: Write your own paragraph<br>Write a paragraph about “My Favorite Hobby”. Make sure your paragraph has:<br>- A topic sentence<br>- At least two supporting details<br>- A concluding sentence"

It paints a picture with words by using sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) and figurative language (similes, metaphors, personification).<br><br>Discussion Questions:<br>Have you ever read a story that made you feel like you were really there?<br>What kinds of words or details made it feel that way?<br><br>Key Point:<br>Descriptive writing helps the reader see, feel, smell, hear, or taste what the writer is describing.",
      "<b>Part 2: Features of Descriptive Writing</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Identify and understand key features of descriptive writing.<br><br>Explanation: The following are features of good descriptive writing:<br><br>1. Sensory Language – Describing what things look like, sound like, smell like, feel like, or taste like.<br><br>2. Figurative Language – Using similes (“as fast as a cheetah”), metaphors (“the sky was a blanket of stars”), and personification (“the wind whispered”).<br><br>3. Vivid Vocabulary – Using specific, interesting words (not just 'nice,' 'big,' or 'bad').<br><br>4. Clear Structure – A beginning, middle, and end with good paragraphing.<br><br>5. Show, Don’t Tell – Instead of saying “she was scared,” show it: “her hands trembled and her heart raced.”<br><br>Class Activity:<br>Read a short descriptive paragraph and identify the sensory details and figurative language.",
      "<b>Part 3: Describing Settings and Characters</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Practice describing places and people using vivid details.<br><br>Explanation: When writing descriptively, writers focus on the setting (place or environment) and the character (how a person looks, moves, feels, and behaves).<br><br>Example Setting:<br>> The sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden shadows over the silent, dusty road. A soft breeze stirred the tall grass, carrying the scent of wildflowers.<br><br>Example Character:<br>> Mrs. Dube had eyes like warm tea and a voice that wrapped around you like a cozy blanket. Her wrinkled hands moved slowly but with care, each motion filled with kindness.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>What do you imagine when you hear these descriptions?<br>What makes them feel real?",
      "<b>Part 4: Planning and Writing Descriptions</b>:<br><br>Objective:<br>Learn how to plan and write a short descriptive paragraph.<br><br>Steps to Write a Descriptive Paragraph:<br><br>1. Choose a topic: (e.g., A rainy day, A market, A mysterious stranger)<br><br>2. Brainstorm sensory details: What do you see, hear, smell, taste, or feel?<br><br>3. Use figurative language: Add similes, metaphors, or personification.<br><br>4. Organize your ideas: Start with a strong opening and build details.<br><br>5. Write and revise: Write your paragraph, then check for vivid words and smooth sentences.<br><br>Model Planning Example (Describing a Beach):<br>Sight: Blue waves, golden sand, children playing<br>Sound: Crashing waves, seagulls calling<br>Smell: Salt in the air<br>Feel: Warm sun on skin, sand between toes<br>Taste: Sweet coconut water",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Descriptive Writing Task</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>Choose one of the following topics and write a descriptive paragraph (6–10 sentences) using the techniques learned:<br><br>1. A rainy afternoon in the village<br><br>2. A busy local market<br><br>3. A strange creature in the forest<br><br>4. Your dream place to visit<br><br>Checklist for Students: ✅ Used at least 3 sensory details<br>✅ Included 1 or more figurative language devices<br>✅ Used vivid vocabulary<br>✅ Wrote in complete sentences<br>✅ Checked spelling and punctuation"

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Subject-Verb Agreement</b>:<br><br><b>What is Subject-Verb Agreement?</b><br>- Every sentence has a <b>subject</b> (who or what the sentence is about) and a <b>verb</b> (the action or state of being).<br>- <b>Subject-verb agreement</b> means that the verb must match the subject in <b>number</b> (singular or plural).<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>1. <b>Singular Subject:</b> *The bird <b>flies</b> high.* (One bird → \"flies\")<br>2. <b>Plural Subject:</b> *The birds <b>fly</b> high.* (Many birds → \"fly\")<br><br><b>Rule:</b><br>- <b>Singular subject</b> → verb + <b>s/es</b> (e.g., runs, eats).<br>- <b>Plural subject</b> → base verb (e.g., run, eat).",
      "<b>Part 2: Rules of Subject-Verb Agreement</b>:<br><br><b>Rule 1: Singular Subjects Take Singular Verbs</b><br>- *The teacher <b>teaches</b> the class.* (Correct: \"teaches\")<br>- *A student <b>answers</b> the question.*<br><br><b>Rule 2: Plural Subjects Take Plural Verbs</b><br>- *The teachers <b>teach</b> the class.*<br>- *Students <b>answer</b> the questions.*<br><br><b>Rule 3: Compound Subjects (Joined by \"and\") Take Plural Verbs</b><br>- *Tom and Jerry <b>are</b> friends.*<br>- *Books and notebooks <b>are</b> on the table.*<br><br><b>Rule 4: When Subjects Are Joined by \"or\" or \"nor,\" the Verb Agrees with the Closest Subject</b><br>- *Either the teacher or the students <b>are</b> responsible.*<br>- *Neither the students nor the teacher <b>knows</b> the answer.*",
      "<b>Part 3: Special Cases & Exceptions</b>:<br><br><b>1. Collective Nouns (Team, Class, Family)</b><br>- If acting as <b>one unit</b>, use a <b>singular verb</b>:<br>  - *The team <b>wins</b> the game.*<br>- If members act <b>individually</b>, use a <b>plural verb</b>:<br>  - *The team <b>are</b> arguing.*<br><br><b>2. Indefinite Pronouns (Everyone, Nobody, Each)</b><br>- Words like <b>everyone, somebody, each</b> take <b>singular verbs</b>:<br>  - *Everybody <b>has</b> a role.*<br>  - *Nobody <b>knows</b> the secret.*<br><br><b>3. Words Ending in \"s\" (News, Mathematics)</b><br>- Some words look plural but are <b>singular</b>:<br>  - *The news <b>is</b> important.*<br>  - *Mathematics <b>is</b> challenging.*",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Exercises</b>:<br><br><b>Exercise 1: Choose the Correct Verb</b><br>1. The dog (barks / bark) loudly.<br>2. My friends (likes / like) soccer.<br>3. Each student (has / have) a book.<br>4. The committee (decides / decide) tomorrow.<br>5. Neither the teacher nor the students (was / were) late.<br><br><b>Exercise 2: Correct the Errors</b><br>1. The children plays in the park.<br>2. Everybody know the answer.<br>3. The group are going on a trip.<br>4. A cat and a dog fights often.<br>5. Mathematics are my favorite subject.<br><br><b>Exercise 3: Create 5 Sentences</b><br>Write <b>5 sentences</b> with correct subject-verb agreement about <b>community helpers</b> (doctors, teachers, police, etc.).",
      "<b>Part 5: Conclusion & Homework</b>:<br><br><b>Summary:</b><br>- <b>Subject-verb agreement</b> ensures sentences are grammatically correct.<br>- Always check if the subject is <b>singular or plural</b> before choosing the verb.<br>- Practice regularly to master the rules!<br><br><b>Homework:</b> Find <b>5 sentences</b> in a Social Studies textbook and identify the subject & verb."
