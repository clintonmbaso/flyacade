      "<b>Part 1: Introduction – What Are Parts of Speech?</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To recall and understand that words in English are grouped into categories called parts of speech, each serving a specific role in a sentence.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>In English, words are organized based on how they are used in a sentence. These categories are called parts of speech. There are eight main parts of speech:<br><br>1. Noun – Names a person, place, thing, or idea.<br>Examples: teacher, school, pencil, happiness<br><br>2. Pronoun – Replaces a noun.<br>Examples: he, she, it, they<br><br>3. Verb – Shows an action or state of being.<br>Examples: run, jump, is, are<br><br>4. Adjective – Describes a noun.<br>Examples: red, tall, quick, kind<br><br>5. Adverb – Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb.<br>Examples: quickly, very, silently<br><br>6. Preposition – Shows the relationship between a noun/pronoun and another word.<br>Examples: on, under, beside, with<br><br>7. Conjunction – Connects words or groups of words.<br>Examples: and, but, or, because<br><br>8. Interjection – Expresses a strong feeling or emotion.<br>Examples: Wow!, Oh!, Ouch!",
      "<b>Part 2: Deep Dive – Examples in Sentences</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To see how each part of speech functions within a sentence.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> Identify and label the parts of speech in these sentences:<br><br>1. The dog (noun) ran (verb) quickly (adverb) across (preposition) the yard.<br><br>2. She (pronoun) wore a beautiful (adjective) dress.<br><br>3. I wanted to go to the park, but (conjunction) it started raining.<br><br>4. Wow! (interjection) That was amazing!<br><br><b>Teacher Tip:</b><br>Use flashcards or write these examples on the board. Ask students to come up and underline or circle the different parts of speech.",
      "<b>Part 3: Why Are Parts of Speech Important?</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To understand how knowledge of parts of speech helps improve reading, writing, and speaking skills.<br><br><b>Discussion Points:</b><br>Knowing the parts of speech helps you construct better sentences.<br>It helps when learning new vocabulary because you understand how words function.<br>When writing stories or essays, using adjectives and adverbs helps make your writing more interesting.<br>Understanding verbs and subjects helps avoid grammatical errors.<br><br><b>Class Discussion Prompt:</b><br>'Why do you think it's important to know what type of word you're using?'<br>Encourage learners to share examples where they used descriptive words in their writing or spoke clearly using a variety of sentence types.",
      "<b>Part 4: Mini Practice with the Class</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To review and reinforce recognition of parts of speech through a fun, interactive group activity.<br><br><b>Activity: Parts of Speech Bingo or Matching Game</b><br><br><b>Option A: Bingo</b><br>Create bingo cards with words that are nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Call out the part of speech and students cover the correct word.<br><br><b>Option B: Matching Game</b><br>Prepare cards—some with words and others with part of speech labels. Students must match them correctly.<br><br><b>Words to Include:</b><br>cat (noun)<br>beautiful (adjective)<br>jump (verb)<br>quickly (adverb)<br>under (preposition)<br>he (pronoun)<br>and (conjunction)<br>wow (interjection)",
      "<b>Part 5: Individual Exercise</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>To assess student understanding of parts of speech.<br><br><b>Instructions:</b><br>Write the sentence. Then underline and label each word with its part of speech.<br><br><b>Exercise A: Identify the Parts of Speech in Each Sentence</b><br>1. The small boy kicked the ball.<br>2. We laughed loudly at the joke.<br>3. Oh! That movie was exciting.<br>4. Sarah and Tim went to the zoo.<br>5. They walked slowly under the bridge.<br><br><b>Exercise B: Fill in the blanks with the correct part of speech</b><br>1. The ________ (adjective) girl sang a song.<br>2.

    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Paragraphs</b>:<br><br>Objective: Understand what a paragraph is and its purpose in writing.<br><br>Explanation:<br>A paragraph is a group of sentences that talk about one main idea.<br>Each paragraph should be organized clearly to help the reader understand the message.<br>Paragraphs make writing easier to read and more interesting.<br><br>Example:<br><i>Paragraphs are like building blocks in writing. Each block has one main idea. When we put several well-built paragraphs together, we create clear and organized writing.</i><br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Ask learners: Why do we need paragraphs in writing?<br>Discuss how writing looks without paragraph breaks.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Topic Sentence</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to identify and write topic sentences.<br><br>Explanation:<br>The topic sentence tells the reader what the paragraph is about.<br>It is usually the first sentence in the paragraph.<br>A strong topic sentence is clear, specific, and introduces the main idea.<br><br>Example:<br><i>Dogs are one of the most loyal pets a person can have.</i><br>This sentence tells the reader that the paragraph will be about dogs and their loyalty.<br><br>Activity:<br>Read three sample sentences and ask learners to pick which one is a topic sentence.<br>Have students create their own topic sentence based on a picture or word prompt (e.g., “school,” “rainy day,” “soccer”).",
      "<b>Part 3: Supporting Details</b>:<br><br>Objective: Understand how to add supporting details to a topic sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>Supporting details are sentences that explain, describe, or give examples related to the topic sentence.<br>They help the reader understand the main idea more deeply.<br><br>Example (Continuing from above):<br><i>Dogs will protect their owners even when in danger. They are always happy to see you when you come home. They can be trained to do many helpful things.</i><br><br>Teaching Tip:<br>Remind learners: If the topic sentence is the “main idea,” supporting details are the “evidence” or “reasons.”<br><br>Activity:<br>Give learners a topic sentence. Ask them to write 2–3 supporting details.<br>Share examples together.",
      "<b>Part 4: The Concluding Sentence</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to write a good concluding sentence.<br><br>Explanation:<br>A concluding sentence comes at the end of the paragraph.<br>It wraps up the paragraph and reminds the reader of the main idea.<br>It can restate the topic or give a final thought.<br><br>Example:<br><i>That’s why dogs are called a person’s best friend.</i><br><br>Tips:<br>Use phrases like “In conclusion,” “That’s why,” “So you can see,” or “To sum up.”<br><br>Practice Together:<br>Look at short paragraphs and underline the concluding sentence.<br>Try writing a concluding sentence for a paragraph with only a topic and supporting details.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercises</b>:<br><br>Objective: Apply knowledge of paragraph structure.<br><br>Exercise 1: Identify the parts<br>Read this paragraph and label the topic sentence, supporting details, and concluding sentence.<br><i>Plants need sunlight to grow. They use sunlight to make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Without sunlight, most plants would die. That is why gardeners always make sure their plants are in sunny places.</i><br><br>Exercise 2: Fill in the blanks<br>Below is a paragraph with missing parts. Fill in the missing sentences:<br><br>Topic Sentence:<br><br>Supporting Detail 1: Elephants use their trunks to pick up food.<br>Supporting Detail 2: They also use it to drink water and take a bath.<br>Concluding Sentence: ___<br><br>Exercise 3: Write your own paragraph<br>Write a paragraph about “My Favorite Hobby”. Make sure your paragraph has:<br>- A topic sentence<br>- At least two supporting details<br>- A concluding sentence"
