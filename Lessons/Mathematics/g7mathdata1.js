      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Set Complement</b>:<br><br>Definition: The complement of a set, denoted as 'A', refers to all elements that are in the universal set U but not in the set A. In simpler terms, the complement consists of everything that is not in set A.<br><br>Notation: If A is a set and U is the universal set, then the complement of A is written as A'.<br><br>Example: Suppose the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the set A = {2, 4}. Then, the complement of A is A' = {1, 3, 5, 6}, because these are the elements in U that are not in A.",
      "<b>Part 2: Key Properties of Set Complement</b>:<br><br>Complement of the complement: The complement of the complement of a set returns the original set: (A')' = A.<br><br>Complement of the universal set: The complement of the universal set is the empty set: U' = Ø.<br><br>Complement of the empty set: The complement of the empty set is the universal set: Ø' = U.<br><br>Complement of the union of sets: The complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements: (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'.<br><br>Complement of the intersection of sets: The complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements: (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'.",
      "<b>Part 3: Visualizing Set Complement with Venn Diagrams</b>:<br><br>Venn Diagrams: A Venn diagram can be used to visually represent the complement of a set. The universal set U is represented by a rectangle, and the set A is represented by a circle within the rectangle. The complement of A consists of the region inside the rectangle but outside the circle.<br><br>Example: Draw a Venn diagram where U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and A = {2, 4}. The complement A' will be the elements {1, 3, 5, 6}.",
      "<b>Part 4: Real-Life Applications of Set Complement</b>:<br><br>Applications in real life: Set complements can be used in various fields, such as:<br><br>1. Database Management: To find entries that do not match a particular condition.<br>2. Surveys: To determine the set of people who did not respond to a specific question.<br>3. Student Attendance: To find students who were absent, given a list of present students.<br><br>Example Scenario: If there is a class of 30 students, and 18 students are present, the complement of the set of present students will give the set of students who are absent. In this case, if P represents present students, then P' would represent absent students.",

Draw a Venn diagram to represent the complement of A.<br><br>Task 3: If A = {2, 4} and B = {4, 6}, calculate the complement of the union A ∪ B if the universal set is U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.<br><br>Task 4: The universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the set A = {2, 4}.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Set Complements</b>:<br><br>Definition of a Set Complement: The complement of a set (denoted as A') includes all the elements that are not in set A. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then the complement of A, denoted A', is {4, 5}.",
      "<b>Part 2: Complement of the Complement (Theoretical Explanation)</b>:<br><br>What Happens When We Take the Complement of the Complement?<br>When we take the complement of the complement of a set, we essentially 'go back' to the original set. Mathematically, this is represented as (A')' = A. This happens because A' consists of all elements not in A. Taking the complement of A' means we are returning to the elements that were originally in A.",
      "<b>Part 3: Why Does This Happen?</b>:<br><br>Understanding the Logic:<br>The complement of a set essentially removes all the elements from the universal set that are in the set A. When we take the complement of that result, we are left with the elements that are in A again. Example: If we start with a universal set of all integers and take the complement of a set of even numbers, the complement would give us all the odd numbers. Then, taking the complement of the odd numbers would bring us back to all the even numbers, just as we started.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practical Applications of the Complement of the Complement</b>:<br><br>Real-Life Context:<br>This concept is useful in many areas such as probability, logic, and computer science. For example, if you are working with a set of customers who made a purchase and the complement represents customers who did not purchase, the complement of the complement would return the original group of customers who made a purchase.<br><br>Logical Thinking:<br>Understanding this concept helps students grasp the idea of negations and the importance of complements in logic and problem-solving.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Solve the following problems. Use the universal set.<br><br>1. Let A = {2, 4, 6}. Find A'.<br>2. Let B = {1, 3, 5}. Find B'.<br>3. If A = {1, 2, 3} and the universal set is U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, find (A')'.<br>4. Explain why (A')' = A using an example from your daily life (e.g., a group of friends, school, etc.).<br>5. Create a set C of your choice, and find (C')'."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Sets</b>:<br><br>A set is a collection of distinct objects or elements. In mathematics, sets are often used to group numbers, letters, or other items based on shared properties. A universal set, denoted by U, is the set that contains all the elements under consideration for a particular problem or discussion. For example, if we are discussing the set of all natural numbers less than 10, the universal set would include all the numbers from 1 to 9.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Complement of a Set</b>:<br><br>The complement of a set, denoted by A', refers to all the elements that are not in set A. In simpler terms, it consists of everything in the universal set U that is not part of A. For example, if set A is the set of even numbers less than 10, its complement A' would be the set of odd numbers less than 10.",
      "<b>Part 3: The Complement of the Universal Set</b>:<br><br>The complement of the universal set is a unique case. If U represents the universal set, then the complement of U, denoted U', would include everything that is not in U. However, since U contains all possible elements under consideration, there is nothing left outside of U. Therefore, the complement of the universal set is the empty set, denoted Ø. The empty set Ø contains no elements. In mathematical terms, we write:<br><br>U' = Ø",
      "<b>Part 4: Visual Representation</b>:<br><br>To better understand this concept, think of the universal set as a large box that holds all elements. If we want the complement of the universal set, we are looking for the set of elements that lie outside this box. Since there is nothing outside the box, the complement is the empty set Ø.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise 5 - Practice Problems</b>:<br><br>1. If the universal set U consists of all natural numbers from 1 to 20, write the complement of the set A where A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.<br>2. Given the universal set U = {a, b, c, d, e} and set B = {b, e}, what is the complement of B?<br>3. If the universal set U is the set of all letters in the alphabet, and set C = {a, e, i, o, u} (the vowels), what is the complement of C?<br>4. The universal set U contains the numbers from 1 to 50. If set D consists of all numbers that are divisible by 5, what is the complement of D?<br>5. If the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and set E = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, find the complement of E."
