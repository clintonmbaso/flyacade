      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Ratios</b>:<br><br>Objective: Introduce the concept of ratios and explain how they compare quantities.<br><br>Begin by discussing the concept of comparison, explaining that ratios are a way to compare two or more quantities. Use real-life examples, such as comparing the number of boys to girls in the classroom (e.g., 'There are 6 boys and 4 girls in our class, the ratio of boys to girls is 6:4'). Highlight that ratios show how much of one quantity there is compared to another. Write several examples on the board:<br>4 apples to 2 oranges<br>5 dogs to 3 cats<br>2 red balls to 6 blue balls",

      "<b>Part 3: Simplifying Ratios</b>:<br><br>Objective: Teach students how to simplify ratios to their simplest form.<br><br>Explain that simplifying a ratio means reducing it so that the numbers are as small as possible, while still showing the same relationship. Show how to simplify a ratio by dividing both parts of the ratio by the greatest common divisor (GCD).<br>Example: Simplify the ratio 8:4.<br>Find the GCD of 8 and 4 (which is 4).<br>Divide both parts by 4:<br>8 ÷ 4 = 2 and 4 ÷ 4 = 1, so the simplified ratio is 2:1.<br>Provide several examples for practice:<br>10:5<br>12:6<br>15:5<br>Have students practice simplifying ratios in pairs or small groups.",

Write the ratio of apples to oranges if there are 7 apples and 5 oranges.<br>2. Simplify the ratio 12:8.<br>3. If you have 15 pencils and 10 pens, what is the ratio of pencils to pens?<br>4. Express the ratio of 20 red balls to 25 blue balls in its simplest form.<br>5. In a classroom, there are 8 boys and 6 girls. What is the ratio of boys to girls? Write it in three forms: using a colon, as a fraction, and with the word 'to'.<br><br>Extension Activity (for early finishers):<br>Create your own ratio problems based on the objects around you (e.g., books, desks, colors). Then exchange them with a partner to solve.<br>Discuss real-life situations where ratios might be used, such as in sports or cooking, and share your answers."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Part-to-Part and Part-to-Whole Ratios</b>:<br><br>Objective: Introduce students to part-to-part and part-to-whole ratios.<br>Start by reviewing what ratios are and the different ways they can be written (e.g., 2:1, 2/1, 2 to 1).<br>Explain the two types of ratios students will be learning today:<br><b>Part-to-Part Ratio</b>: Compares one part of a whole to another part. Example: In a class of 10 boys and 5 girls, the part-to-part ratio of boys to girls is 10:5.<br><b>Part-to-Whole Ratio</b>: Compares one part of a whole to the total of all parts. Example: In a class of 10 boys and 5 girls, the part-to-whole ratio of boys to the total class is 10:15, or simplified to 2:3.<br>Provide students with more examples to practice: If there are 4 dogs and 6 cats, write the part-to-part ratio of dogs to cats. If there are 8 apples and 12 oranges, write the part-to-whole ratio of apples to the total number of fruits.",
      "<b>Part 2: Setting Up and Solving Proportion Equations</b>:<br><br>Objective: Teach students how to set up and solve proportion equations.<br>Explain that a proportion is an equation that shows two ratios are equivalent. Example: The ratio 3:5 is equal to the ratio 6:10 because 3/5 = 6/10.<br>Introduce the concept of cross-multiplication to solve proportions: In the proportion 3/5 = 6/x, multiply 3 by x and 5 by 6 to get: 3 * x = 5 * 6. This simplifies to: 3x = 30. Then, divide both sides by 3: x = 10.<br>Provide more examples and have students solve them: 2/4 = 5/x, 7/10 = 14/20, 3/x = 6/9. Emphasize that when solving proportions, they must always check that the ratios are equivalent after solving.",

For example, if there are 3 apples and 5 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5.<br><br>Proportion is when two ratios are equal. For example, if the ratio of apples to oranges is the same as the ratio of pears to bananas, we can say the two ratios form a proportion.<br><br>Explanation:<br>Introduce the term \"ratio\" and explain it using everyday examples, such as comparing the number of students in different classes or comparing the number of red and blue marbles in a jar.<br><br>Discuss how we write ratios (e.g., 3:5, or 3 to 5) and how they show the relationship between two numbers.<br><br>Introduce \"proportion\" as an equation that states two ratios are equal (e.g., 3:5 = 6:10).

      "<b>Part 2: Real-Life Applications of Ratio and Proportion</b>:<br><br>Concept:<br>Ratios and proportions are used in real-life situations such as cooking, scaling, and map reading.<br><br>Explanation:<br>Cooking: When following a recipe, ingredients are often given in ratios. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar, the ratio is 2:3. If you want to make a larger or smaller batch, you can use proportion to adjust the ingredients accordingly.<br><br>Scaling: When drawing maps or models, ratios help to scale down or scale up the size of objects while maintaining their proportions. For instance, a map might have a ratio of 1:1000, meaning 1 cm on the map represents 1000 cm in real life.<br><br>Map Reading: Discuss how maps often use a scale to represent real-world distances.

A recipe calls for 2 cups of milk for every 5 cups of flour. How much milk is needed for 10 cups of flour?<br>5. A map has a scale of 1:1000. What does 3 cm on the map represent in real life?<br>6. If the ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:7, and there are 21 blue marbles, how many red marbles are there?<br>7. Write a proportion for the ratio 2:3 = x:9 and solve for x.<br>8.

(How fast the cost increases.)",
      "<b>Part 3: Applying Proportional Thinking in Real Life</b>:<br><br>Concept:<br>Proportional relationships help us make predictions and solve problems in real life.<br><br>Examples & Discussion:<br>Speed: If a car travels 60 km in 1 hour, it will travel 120 km in 2 hours, 180 km in 3 hours, etc. (Proportional relationship between time and distance).<br><br>Shopping: 1 pack of pencils costs K8. How much will 5 packs cost? Multiply K8 × 5 = K40.<br><br>Cooking: A recipe needs 2 cups of rice for 4 people. For 8 people, you’ll need 4 cups (the amount of rice is proportional to the number of people).<br><br>Group Discussion:<br>Can you think of other times in life when things grow at a steady rate?

      "<b>Part 4: Recognizing Linear Relationships That Are Not Proportional</b>:<br><br>Concept:<br>Not all straight lines are proportional.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Symmetry</b>:<br><br>Start by explaining symmetry in simple terms. Tell the students that symmetry is when a shape or object can be folded or split into two equal parts that are mirror images of each other. For example, if you fold a paper in half, and both sides match perfectly, the paper has symmetry. Show them some common objects that have symmetry, such as butterflies, leaves, or a heart.<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b><br>Symmetry means balance or equality on both sides.<br>Shapes can have one or more lines of symmetry.<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>Ask students to identify objects they see every day that have symmetry.<br>Discuss whether any objects do not have symmetry.",
      "<b>Part 2: Types of Symmetry – Reflection, Rotation, and Translation</b>:<br><br><b>1. Reflection (Mirror Symmetry):</b><br>Explain that reflection happens when an object is flipped over a line (called the line of reflection). It creates a mirror image of the original object.<br>Example: A butterfly’s wings are symmetrical in reflection, as one wing is a mirror image of the other.<br><br><b>2. Rotation (Rotational Symmetry):</b><br>Show that rotation involves turning an object around a center point. The object will look the same after a certain degree of rotation.<br>Example: A star may look the same if you rotate it by 72 degrees.<br><br><b>3. Translation (Sliding Symmetry):</b><br>Translation means moving an object from one place to another without rotating or flipping it. The object stays the same.<br>Example: A pattern of shapes that repeats in rows and columns shows translation.<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Draw different shapes on the board and demonstrate each transformation. For instance, show how flipping a triangle creates a reflection, rotating a square results in rotational symmetry, and sliding a circle to the right shows translation.",
      "<b>Part 3: Identifying Symmetry in Shapes</b>:<br><br>Explain how to identify symmetry in shapes. Discuss the lines of symmetry and how every symmetrical shape has at least one. Show examples of shapes like squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles.<br><br><b>Shapes with Symmetry:</b><br>Square (4 lines of symmetry)<br>Rectangle (2 lines of symmetry)<br>Equilateral triangle (3 lines of symmetry)<br>Circle (infinite lines of symmetry)<br><br><b>Class Exercise:</b><br>Give the students cut-out shapes or use a drawing of various shapes on the board.<br>Ask them to draw the line(s) of symmetry they can see on each shape.",

Guide them through drawing a shape, then folding the paper to ensure that the two halves are symmetrical.<br><br><b>Step-by-Step Creation:</b><br>1. Draw a half-shape (like half of a butterfly wing).<br>2. Fold the paper along the line of symmetry and trace the folded part to complete the shape.<br>3. Discuss how the final shape looks the same on both sides.<br><br><b>Materials Needed:</b> Paper, pencils, rulers, and scissors (for cut-out shapes).",
