      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Decimals</b><br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Introduce students to the concept of decimals and place value after the decimal point.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>A decimal is a way of writing numbers that are not whole.<br>A decimal has two parts: the whole number part and the fractional (decimal) part, separated by a decimal point.<br><br>For example: 3.5 means 3 whole and 5 tenths.<br><br><b>Place Value Reminder:</b><br>On the left side of the decimal point: ones, tens, hundreds...<br>On the right side: tenths, hundredths, thousandths...<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>7.23 →<br>7 is the whole number<br>2 is in the tenths place<br>3 is in the hundredths place<br><br><b>Class Discussion Prompt:</b><br>Why do we need decimals in real life?
