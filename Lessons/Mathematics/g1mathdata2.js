      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Standard Units of Capacity</b>:<br><br>Teacher Explains:<br>Ask: “What do we use to measure juice, milk, or water at the shop?”<br>Introduce liters (L) and milliliters (mL) as standard units for measuring liquids.<br><br>Visual Aids:<br>Show a 1-liter bottle (e.g., soda bottle).<br>Show a small medicine cup or juice box labeled in milliliters.<br><br>Key Points:<br>1 liter = 1,000 milliliters<br>Liters are used for large amounts of liquid.<br>Milliliters are used for small amounts of liquid.",
      
      "<b>Part 2: When to Use Liters vs. Milliliters</b>:<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Which would we use to measure:<br>A cup of juice? (→ milliliters)<br>A big water bottle? (→ liters)<br>A spoon of cough syrup? (→ milliliters)<br>A bucket of water? (→ liters)<br><br>Real-Life Examples:<br>Milk carton (1 L or 500 mL)<br>Juice box (200 mL)<br>Medicine bottle (100 mL)<br>Water jug (2 L or more)",
      
      "<b>Part 3: Using Measuring Cups and Bottles</b>:<br><br>Teacher Demonstrates:<br>Show a measuring cup labeled in milliliters and liters.<br>Pour water into the cup to show how it fills to different levels:<br>“Look, we have 250 mL of water here.”<br>“Now it’s 1 liter.”<br><br>Learners Observe and Repeat:<br>In small groups or pairs, learners practice:<br>Pouring 100 mL into a cup<br>Filling a bottle to 1 liter<br>Comparing different amounts of water in milliliters<br><br>Safety Note: Use water, not real juice or chemicals.",
      
      "<b>Part 4: Comparing Capacities in Standard Units</b>:<br><br>Hands-On Comparison:<br>Provide groups with several labeled containers (e.g., 250 mL, 500 mL, 1 L).<br>Learners line up containers from smallest to largest capacity.<br><br>Ask Questions:<br>“Which container holds the least?”<br>“Can you find two containers that together equal 1 liter?”<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Emphasize that we use mL for small things like drinks and L for big things like jugs and water bottles.",
      
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Let’s Practice!)</b>:<br><br>1. Match the object to the correct unit:<br>| Object              | Unit to Use     |<br>|---------------------|-----------------|<br>| Medicine bottle     | a) liters        |<br>| Water bucket        | b) milliliters  |<br>| Juice box           | c) milliliters  |<br>| Cooking pot         | d) liters        |<br><br>2. Fill in the blanks:<br>a) 1 liter = _______ milliliters<br>b) I would use _______ to measure a spoon of medicine.<br>c) A big bottle of water is usually measured in ______.<br><br>3. Circle the correct unit:<br>a) A soda bottle – (mL / L)<br>b) A teacup – (L / mL)<br>c) A milk jug – (L / mL)<br><br>4. Tick (✓) what we use to measure liquid in liters or milliliters:<br>[ ] Ruler<br>[ ] Measuring cup<br>[ ] Scale<br>[ ] Syringe<br><br>5. Home Task:<br>With an adult, look at three bottles or containers in your home. Write the names and their capacities (e.g., “Milk – 1 L, Juice – 250 mL, Water bottle – 500 mL”)."
