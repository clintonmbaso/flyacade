            "<b>Part 1: Introduction – What is Area? (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'Good morning, super mathematicians! Today, we are going to become space explorers. But not outer space—we’re exploring the space inside shapes! This space has a special name. It’s called AREA.'<br><br>(Define Area Simply) 'Area is the amount of flat space a shape covers.Let's think of it like this:<br><br>· If this whiteboard were a giant picture, the area would be the part we can actually draw on.<br>· If this book is a chocolate bar, the area is the big piece of chocolate you get to eat!<br>· The area of a soccer field is all the grass inside the white lines.<br><br>We measure area in square units. It's like using little square tiles to see how many it takes to completely cover a shape without any gaps.'<br><br>(Interactive Demo) Hold up a book.'Look at the cover of this book. If I had tiny square stickers, the area would be how many stickers I need to cover the whole front of the book. The bigger the space, the more stickers I would need!'<br><br>Key Question: 'So, if I have a small sticky note and a big poster, which one has a larger area?' (Let students answer and explain their thinking).",
            "<b>Part 2: Measuring Area with Square Tiles (20 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'Now that we know what area is, how do we actually measure it? We use our special tools: square tiles! We are going to be tile experts.'<br><br>(Group Activity)<br><br>1. Divide students into small groups and give each group a handful of square tiles and a few small rectangular objects (e.g., an index card, a small book, a rectangular piece of construction paper).<br>2. Instruct them: 'Your mission is to find the area of your object. Carefully place the tiles down, one by one, side-by-side to cover the entire surface of your object. Make sure there are no gaps and no overlaps!'<br>3. Let the groups work. Walk around and ask guiding questions: 'How many tiles did you use? Does your partner's object need more or fewer tiles?'<br>4. Bring the class back together. Ask a few groups to share their object and how many tiles it took to cover it (e.g., 'Our index card had an area of 12 square tiles!').<br><br>Key Takeaway: 'The number of squares we used is the area! We can say the area is 12 square units. The 'units' are our tiles.'",
            "<b>Part 3: Comparing Areas (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'We can use what we know about area to compare shapes and see which one takes up more space.'<br><br>(Visual Comparison on Board) Draw two rectangles on the board,one clearly larger than the other. 'Look at Rectangle A and Rectangle B.By just looking, which one do you think has a greater area? Why?' (Students will likely point to the bigger one).<br><br>(Tricky Comparison) Now,draw two rectangles that are different shapes but have a less obvious difference (e.g., one is long and skinny, one is short and wide). 'Hmmm,this is trickier. Is Rectangle C bigger than Rectangle D? It's hard to tell just by looking. What is the best way to know for sure?' (Guide them to answer: by measuring or by counting squares).<br><br>(Guided Practice with Grid Paper) Show a worksheet on a projector or draw it on the board.Have two rectangles drawn on a grid. 'Look at these shapes on the grid.Every little square is one unit. Let's count the squares inside each shape to find its area. Now we know for sure which one is bigger!'<br><br>Key Takeaway: 'Sometimes we can see which area is bigger, but the best way to be sure is to count the squares!'",
            "<b>Part 4: Let's Practice Together! (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'Let's try one all together before you work on your own.'<br><br>Draw this simple shape on grid paper on the board:<br><br>```<br>[Draw a rectangle that is 4 squares long and 3 squares wide.]<br>```<br><br>'Okay team, what is the area of this rectangle? Let's count the squares together!'<br><br>· Guide them to count each square one by one, or to see the rows: 'I see 4 squares in this row. And there are 3 rows! So what is 4 + 4 + 4?' or 'What is 4 groups of 3?'<br>· 'That's right! The area is 12 square units. Fantastic counting!'",
            "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Independent Work) (15-20 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Name: _________________________ Date:_________________________<br><br>Wing Whiz Mathematics: Exploring Area!<br><br>1. Count the Squares. Find the area of each shape by counting the square units.<br><br>```<br>[Image 1: A simple L-shape made of 6 squares.]<br>Area = ____ square units<br><br>[Image 2: A rectangle that is 5x2, made of 10 squares.]<br>Area = ____ square units<br>```<br><br>2.

Today we are going to meet a new shape friend and learn about the space he lives in!' )<br><br>Let's meet our shape friend for today: Sammy the Square!<br><br>Sammy is a very special shape. He has four sides, and here's his secret: all four of his sides are exactly the same length! That's what makes him a square!<br><br>The word we use for the space inside a shape is called AREA. It's like the shape's personal backyard. Today, we are going to learn how to measure Sammy's backyard—the area of a square.<br><br>To find out how big his space is, we don't need to guess. We have a super math trick! The trick is:<br><br>Area = Side × Side<br><br>This means you take the length of one side (let's call it S) and multiply it by itself.<br><br>· Why one side? Because remember, all sides of a square are equal! If one side is 3 cm, all sides are 3 cm.",

Since we measured in 'units,' our area is in 'square units.'<br><br>· Area = 9 square units<br><br>This means it would take 9 little squares (each 1 unit wide and 1 unit tall) to perfectly cover up Sammy the Square without any gaps.<br><br>We can write 'square units' a shorter way: units². The little ² means 'squared.' So, we can also say the area is 9 units².",

You just calculated the area all by yourself! The space inside Sasha Square is 25 square centimeters.",
            "<b>Part 4: Important Note!</b>:<br><br>Remember, we can only use Side × Side for squares. Why? Because this magic trick only works if every side is exactly the same length!<br><br>A rectangle has different side lengths, so it has a different magic trick (Length × Width), which we might learn another day. But for our perfect square friends, Side × Side is the perfect trick!",

Today, we have a fun mystery to solve. Imagine our friend, Sammy Squirrel, wants to plant grass in his new backyard. But his backyard is a funny shape! It's not a perfect square or rectangle.'<br><br>(Draw the irregular shape on the board and label it 'Sammy's Backyard'.)<br><br>'How can we figure out how much grass seed he needs? We need to find the area! We already know how to find the area of squares and rectangles.

Where can we draw a line to split this into shapes we know?'<br><br>(Ask for student volunteers to come up and draw lines. Guide them to see they can draw one vertical or horizontal line to create two rectangles. Color each resulting rectangle a different color.)<br><br>'Excellent! We've broken our irregular shape into Rectangle A (color it blue) and Rectangle B (color it red).'<br><br>Step 2: Find the Area of Each Part 'Now,let's investigate each rectangle. For Rectangle A, let's count the length and width. How many units long is it? How many units wide?' (e.g., Guide them to see it's 5 units long and 4 units wide.) 'So,what is the area of Rectangle A? Let's calculate: 5 x 4 = 20. The area is 20 square units.'<br><br>'Now, let's look at Rectangle B. How long and how wide is it?' (e.g., It's 2 units long and 2 units wide.) 'Great!2 x 2 = 4.

But first, let's remember what area is.<br><br>· Area is the amount of space a flat shape takes up.<br>· Imagine you're painting a wall. The area is how much paint you would need to cover it!<br>· We measure area in square units, like square centimeters (cm²) or square meters (m²). It's like little square tiles covering a floor.<br><br>For Squares and Rectangles: We have a superpower to find area without counting every single square!<br><br>· For a RECTANGLE: Area = Length × Width<br>· For a SQUARE: Area = Side × Side (Since all sides are equal!)<br><br>Teacher's Note: Remember, length is the longer side, and width is the shorter side. For squares, you can use 'side' for both.",
            "<b>Part 2: Finding Area in Real Life! 🏠</b>:<br><br>We can find rectangles and squares everywhere! Let's look at some examples:<br><br>Example 1: The New Classroom Rug Your classroom is getting a new rectangular rug.It is 4 meters long and 3 meters wide. What is its area?<br><br>· Think: Area of a rectangle = Length × Width<br>· Calculate: 4 m × 3 m = 12 square meters (m²)<br>· So, the area of the rug is 12 m². We need to buy a rug that is 12 square meters!<br><br>Example 2: A Tile for the Art Project You are making a mosaic art project using small square tiles.Each tile is 5 centimeters on each side. What is the area of one tile?<br><br>· Think: Area of a square = Side × Side<br>· Calculate: 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters (cm²)<br>· So, one tile covers 25 cm² of space on your artwork.",
