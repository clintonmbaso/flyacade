            "<b>Part 1: What is a Pattern? (The Hook!)</b>:<br><br>(Teacher says: 'Good morning, Feather Flyers! Today, we are going to become Pattern Detectives! Our mission is to find patterns everywhere!' )<br><br>1. Introduction: 'Look around the room.Can you see anything that repeats? Look at your friend's shirt. Look at the rug. Look at the windows!' (Allow students to point things out.)<br><br>2. Show and Tell: Hold up your patterned item(e.g., the striped scarf). 'Look at my scarf!It has colors that repeat. See? Blue, red, blue, red, blue, red. The colors do the same thing over and over again. That is called a pattern!'<br><br>3. Simple Definition: 'A pattern is when something repeats itself,like a song chorus or a dance move we do again and again. Patterns are all around us and they help make things beautiful and fun!'<br><br>4. Everyday Examples:<br><br>· 'Day and Night: Day, night, day, night...'<br>· 'The seasons: Summer, fall, winter, spring, summer...'<br>· Clap a rhythm: Clap, stomp, clap, stomp... (Have the students join in).<br><br>(Teacher says: 'You are already great detectives! Let's learn how to talk about patterns.' )",
            "<b>Part 2: Recognizing and Naming Patterns</b>:<br><br>(Teacher says: 'Patterns have a special name called the core. The core is the part that repeats, like the heart of the pattern!' )<br><br>1. Visual Pattern on the Board: Draw this pattern on the board using colors or shapes: 🔺 ▲ 🔺 ▲ 🔺 ▲<br><br>2. Identify the Core: 'Let's look at this pattern together.What do you see first? A triangle! Then another triangle! But are they the same? No! One is red and one is blue. They are a team that repeats! The team 'red triangle, blue triangle' is the core.'<br><br>Circle the first 🔺 ▲ to show the core. 'This little part repeats over and over to make the whole pattern.'<br><br>3. Say It Aloud: 'Let's say the pattern together:Red triangle, blue triangle, red triangle, blue triangle...' (Point to each shape as you say it).<br><br>4. Another Example: Draw this pattern:⭐ 🌙 ⭐ 🌙 ⭐ 🌙 'What is the core of this pattern?'(Guide them to see it's 'star, moon'). 'Let's say it:Star, moon, star, moon...'<br><br>(Teacher says: 'Wow! You found the core! Now, what if a pattern is missing a piece? Can you help fix it?' )",
            "<b>Part 3: What Comes Next? (Extending Patterns)</b>:<br><br>(Teacher says: 'Sometimes a pattern needs our help to keep going. We have to figure out what comes next!' )<br><br>1. Continue a Pattern: Draw an incomplete pattern on the board: 🐶 🐱 🐶 🐱 🐶 _____<br><br>'Oh no! Our pattern of dog, cat, dog, cat, dog... is missing the last piece! What comes next? What was the core?' (The core is dog, cat). 'So after dog,we need... a cat! Great job!'<br><br>2. Hands-On Practice: Use your collection of objects.Start a pattern on your desk where everyone can see it (e.g., red block, blue block, red block, blue block). 'Who can come up and add the next item to my pattern?'(Call on a student to place the next block).<br><br>Do this with 2-3 different simple patterns (e.g., bear, bear, fish / bear, bear, fish...).<br><br>(Teacher says: 'You are all pattern experts! Now for the most fun part... you get to make your own!' )",
            "<b>Part 4: Let's Create Patterns!</b>:<br><br>(Teacher says: 'It's time for us to be artists and use our creativity!' )<br><br>1. Group Activity: 'Human Patterns' 'Let's make a pattern with ourselves!I need a pattern of: Sit, Stand, Sit, Stand...' (Guide the first row of students to sit, the second to stand, and so on). 'Now let's make a pattern with sounds:Clap, Snap, Clap, Snap...' (Do this all together).<br><br>2. Individual Creation: Give each student a handful of different colored blocks or counters. 'Your mission,Pattern Detectives, is to create your own pattern on your desk. You can use colors, shapes, or types of object. When you're done, you will show your partner and see if they can guess your core!'<br><br>Walk around the room to help students who are struggling and praise those who have created a pattern.",
            "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Let's Practice!)</b>:<br><br>Activity: 'Complete the Pattern' Worksheet Hand out a simple worksheet.The worksheet should have two activities:<br><br>Section A: What comes next? (Pictures of patterns with the last one or two items missing). Example:<br><br>1. 🍎 🍌 🍎 🍌 🍎 ______<br>2. ◯ ▢ △ ◯ ▢ △ ◯ ______ ______<br><br>Section B: Create Your Own Pattern! (Provide a row of empty boxes and a sheet of images to cut out:e.g., stars, hearts, circles, squares in different colors). Instructions:'Cut out the pictures and glue them in the boxes to make your very own repeating pattern.'<br><br>Wrap-Up: 'Feather Flyers,you were amazing Pattern Detectives today! You found patterns, you named them, and you even created your own. Tonight, see how many patterns you can find at home! Maybe on a blanket, on a plate, or even in your dinner—peas, carrot, peas, carrot!'<br><br>Key Words for the Day: Pattern, Repeats, Core"

      "<b>Part 1: What is a Pattern? (Introduction)</b>:<br><br>(Teacher stands at the front, wearing a fun striped scarf or holding up a picture of a zebra.)<br><br>'Good morning, Feather Flyers! Look at my scarf. What do you see?' (Wait for answers like 'stripes!' or 'red and blue!')<br><br>'That's right! It has stripes of red, blue, red, blue, red, blue. It repeats! When something repeats over and over in the same order, we call that a pattern!'<br><br>'Patterns are everywhere! Can you think of some?'<br><br>· Day and Night (day, night, day, night...)<br>· The seasons (summer, fall, winter, spring, summer...)<br>· On your clothes!<br><br>'Today, we are going to become Pattern Detectives! We will learn to spot patterns, figure out their secret rule, and even make our own!'",
      "<b>Part 2: Finding the Pattern Rule (Visual Patterns)</b>:<br><br>(Teacher draws on the whiteboard.)<br><br>'Let's look at this pattern. What do you see?' 🍎 🍌 🍎 🍌 🍎 🍌<br><br>'That's right! An apple, a banana, an apple, a banana! The pattern repeats. The rule for this pattern is apple, banana. What do you think comes next?' (Point to the next empty space. Students will say 'apple!')<br><br>'Excellent! You figured out the rule! Let's try a trickier one.'<br><br>(Teacher draws a new pattern:) 🔴 🔴 🔵 🔴 🔴 🔵 ___ ___<br><br>'Oh my! Look at this pattern. Red, Red, Blue... Red, Red, Blue... What is the rule? It's a group that repeats: Red, Red, Blue. So what comes next?' (Guide them to see that after Blue, the pattern starts over. The next two shapes should be Red and Red.)<br><br>'The rule tells us what comes next. Being a Pattern Detective is all about finding the rule!'",
      "<b>Part 3: Number Patterns are Fun Too! (Numeric Patterns)</b>:<br><br>'Patterns aren't just with colors and shapes. Numbers love to make patterns too! The easiest pattern is counting! Let's count together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... The rule is add one each time!'<br><br>'Let's look at this pattern on the board:' 2, 4, 6, 8, __, __<br><br>'Hmm. We're counting, but we're skipping numbers! 2...4...6...8. What's the rule? We are counting by twos! So, if 8 is two more than 6, what is two more than 8?' (Students will say 10) 'And two more than 10?' (Students will say 12)<br><br>'Wonderful! You just extended a number pattern! The rule was add two.'",
      "<b>Part 4: Let's Create Patterns! (Guided Practice)</b>:<br><br>'Now it's your turn to be Pattern Creators! I need your help.'<br><br>(Pull out the bag of colored blocks or beads.)<br><br>'I'm going to start a pattern, and you will help me finish it. My pattern is: Red block, Blue block, Red block, Blue block... What comes next?' (Let a student come place a blue block. Then ask what comes after that, and have another student place a red block.)<br><br>'Perfect! Now, let's make a trickier one. Who can help me make a pattern with the rule: Circle, Square, Triangle?' (Call on three different students to each draw one shape on the board in the correct order to start the pattern. Then ask the class what the next three shapes should be.)<br><br>'You are all amazing Pattern Detectives and Creators!'",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise Time! (Your Turn to Fly Solo!)</b>:<br><br>'Alright, Feather Flyers, it's time for your mission! On your worksheet, you have three important jobs.'<br><br>Instructions for the worksheet (to be read aloud):<br><br>1. What Comes Next? Look at the pattern and draw the next two items in the box.     *   Example:△ ○ □ △ ○ □ __ __     *   Example:🌟 🌟 🌙 🌟 🌟 🌙 __ __<br><br>2. Find the Pattern Rule. Circle the set of shapes that repeats over and over.     *   Example:In the pattern (🔺🟥🔺🟥), the repeating core is (🔺🟥).<br><br>3. Create Your Own Pattern! Use your crayons to create two patterns in the empty boxes.     *   Draw one color pattern(e.g., red, blue, green, red, blue, green...).     *   Draw one shape pattern(e.g., circle, star, circle, star...).<br><br>(As students work, walk around the room to provide help and encouragement. Praise their creative patterns!)<br><br>Wrap-up: 'Wow! Look at all the wonderful patterns you found and made! You can be a Pattern Detective everywhere you go—look for patterns at home, on the playground, and in your books. Great job today, Feather Flyers!'"
