Commonly used in scientific research to determine cause-and-effect relationships. Example: Testing how different amounts of sunlight affect plant growth.<br>3. Observations: Involve watching and recording behaviors, events, or conditions without interference, useful in studying natural behaviors or environments. Example: Observing the behavior of animals in the wild.",
      "<b>Choosing the Right Method:</b><br>The choice of data collection method depends on the research question, the type of data needed, and available resources. Surveys are suitable for collecting opinions, experiments for testing theories, and observations for studying natural settings. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages: Surveys are quick and cost-effective but can be biased if not well-designed; Experiments provide reliable results but can be time-consuming and costly; Observations offer real-world insights but can lack control over variables.

For example, in a table of student test scores, rows might represent students, columns show subjects like Math, English, and Science, and headers name the subjects.",
      "<b>How to Read and Create a Table:</b><br>To read a table, start by examining the headers to understand what each column represents, then read across the rows to see the information. For example, in a student score table, you can easily compare scores by reading across rows and down columns. When creating a table, decide on the data, select clear headers for each column, fill in the correct information in each row, and ensure data alignment for readability.",

      "<b>Introduction to Line Plots:</b><br>A line plot is a type of graph that displays data along a number line, showing how often each value occurs. Each 'X' or mark above a number represents one data point, making it easy to see which values occur most or least frequently. Line plots are useful for organizing and displaying small sets of data, such as survey results or measurements. For example, a line plot can show how many books each student read in a month, making it clear who read the most or least.",

The number line shows the range of data values, while the data points above the line indicate the frequency of each value.
