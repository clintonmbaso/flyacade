            "<b>Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes) – The Magic Box</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'Good morning, little Baby Birds! Are you ready for some number magic today? Look what I have! A big, magic box! Let's see what's inside.'<br><br>(The teacher shakes the empty, closed box) 'Hmmm, do you hear anything? Let's open it and see!'<br><br>(The teacher slowly opens the box and turns it upside down. Nothing falls out.)<br><br>'Oh! There is nothing inside! The box is completely empty. When there is nothing, we say ZERO! Can everyone say 'zero'? Wonderful!'<br><br>(Hold up the '0' flashcard) 'This is the number ZERO. It looks like a big, round egg! Let's all make a circle with our arms like a zero. Amazing!'",
            "<b>Part 2: Introducing Number One (5 minutes) – Special Friend</b>:<br><br>Teacher's Script: 'Now, let's use our magic! Abracadabra! I will put something into the box.'<br><br>(The teacher puts the single toy, e.g., a teddy bear, into the box and closes it. Shakes the box so it makes a sound.)<br><br>'Ooh! Now I hear something! Let's see what it is!'<br><br>(Opens the box and pulls out the one teddy bear.)<br><br>'Look! It's Teddy! How many Teddies are there? Let's count together. One! There is one teddy bear.'<br><br>(Hold up the '1' flashcard) 'This is the number ONE. It's a straight line, like a soldier standing tall! Let's all stand up tall like the number one! Fantastic!'",
            "<b>Part 3: Story and Song Time (7-8 minutes)</b>:<br><br>a) Story Connection: 'Now, let's read a story. Does anyone know about the hungry caterpillar?'<br><br>(Show the page of the book where the caterpillar eats through one apple.) 'Look! On Monday, he ate through one apple. How many apples? One! And look at his plate later... all gone! How many apples are left? Zero! He ate them all up!'<br><br>b) Action Song: 'Let's sing a song about our new friend, Zero!' (Sing to the tune of 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star')<br><br>'Zero, zero, means that there's none, Like when all the cookies are gone! One, one, means just you, Like one shoe, or one kite that's new! Zero, zero, means that there's none, Now our counting song is done!'<br><br>(Do actions: hold up round arms for 'zero', hold up one finger for 'one', mime eating for 'cookies are gone', point to a shoe.)",
            "<b>Part 4: Guided Practice (5 minutes) – Show Me</b>:<br><br>Activity: 'Now, let's play a game! I need your help.'<br><br>1. Hold up the '0' flashcard: 'If I show you ZERO, I want you to show me empty hands, like this!' (Teacher demonstrates open, empty palms)<br>2. Hold up the '1' flashcard: 'If I show you ONE, I want you to hold up just one finger, like this!' (Teacher holds up one index finger)<br><br>(Mix the cards up and quiz them quickly and playfully. Praise all efforts enthusiastically.)<br><br>'Wow! You are all so clever! You know zero and one!'",
            "<b>Part 5: Exercise / Activity (5-7 minutes) – Draw It!</b>:<br><br>Instructions: 'Now it's time for you to be artists! I have a special paper for you.'<br><br>(Hand out the drawing paper. It should have two large sections, pre-drawn by the teacher.)<br><br>1. First Section: Has the numeral 0 and an empty plate. The instruction (for the teacher/helper to explain) is: 'This is Zero. Can you colour the number zero? Look, the plate is empty! There are zero cookies.'<br>2. Second Section: Has the numeral 1 and a image of a single candle on a cake. The instruction is: 'This is One. Can you colour the number one? There is one candle on the cake. Can you draw one flame on the candle?'<br><br>What the teacher does:<br><br>· Circulate around the class.<br>· Ask individual children: 'How many candles are on your cake?' (Looking for the answer 'One')<br>· Ask: 'How many cookies are on this plate?' (Looking for the answer 'Zero' or 'None')<br>· Praise their colouring and their correct answers.<br><br>Conclusion: 'Excellent job today, my brilliant Baby Birds! You learned about zero, which is nothing, and one, which is single! Give yourselves one big clap! Yay!'<br><br>We will practice this every day this week!"

Fly away, Paul! > (Hide one hand behind your back, then the other) > Come back, Peter! Come back, Paul! > (Bring each hand back one at a time)<br>3. Sing the song slowly and do the actions. Encourage the children to copy you. Repeat the song 2-3 times.",
      "<b>Part 4: Creative Activity (Craft) (8-10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Goal: To create a tactile art project that reinforces the shape of the number 2.<br><br>Activity: 'Decorate the Number 2'<br><br>Teacher's Activity:<br><br>1. Before the lesson, draw or print a large, bubble-number 2 on a piece of paper for each child.<br>2. Show the children your example. 'Look, this is our friend, the number 2! We are going to make it beautiful.'<br>3. Give each child their paper.<br>4. Offer them TWO choices for decorating:<br>   · 'Would you like TWO stickers?' (Give them two stickers to place on their number).<br>   · 'Or would you like to use TWO colours?' (Offer two crayon colours to scribble with on the number).<br>5. As they work, circulate and praise them. 'Wow, you used TWO red stickers! Beautiful!' or 'I see you used TWO colours on your number 2!'<br><br>(For an alternative, you could use playdough and help them roll two small balls and press them onto the number 2).",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise & Cool Down (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Goal: To assess understanding in a playful way and end the lesson calmly.<br><br>Exercise 1: 'Show Me Two'<br><br>· The teacher holds up a flashcard with a picture (e.g., one fish, two cars, three stars, one balloon).<br>· The teacher asks: 'Can you see TWO cars? Show me with your fingers!' (Children should hold up two fingers).<br>· Do this with 3-4 different cards, mixing in pictures of one and two items. Clap and cheer when they get it right. It's okay if they don't; just gently guide them.<br><br>Exercise 2: 'Find Two'<br><br>· Scatter a few blocks on the floor in the middle of the circle.<br>· Ask one or two children at a time: 'Can you find TWO blocks and bring them to me?'<br>· Praise them enthusiastically when they do. 'You did it! You found one, two blocks! Thank you!'<br><br>Cool Down:<br><br>· 'We learned all about the number 2 today! You were all fantastic!'<br>· Finish by holding up the number 2 flashcard one last time. 'Can everyone wave goodbye to the number 2? Bye-bye, number two!'<br>· Sing a goodbye song: 'Goodbye, goodbye, it's time to go. Goodbye, goodbye, I'll miss you so!' (Sing it twice!)."
