      "<b>Part 1: Historical Overview of Roman Numerals</b>:<br><br>Begin by explaining the origin of Roman numerals and their significance in ancient Rome.<br><br>Discuss how they were used for recording numbers in commerce, construction, and daily life.<br><br>Highlight their continued relevance today in clocks, book chapters, and important events like the Olympics.",
      "<b>Part 2: Roman Numeral Symbols and Their Values</b>:<br><br>Teach the basic symbols and their corresponding values:<br><br>I = 1<br>V = 5<br>X = 10<br>L = 50<br>C = 100<br>D = 500<br>M = 1,000<br><br>Provide visual aids, such as a chart or flashcards, to help students memorize the values.",
      "<b>Part 3: Rules for Writing and Reading Roman Numerals</b>:<br><br>Explain the key rules for forming Roman numerals:<br><br>1. Repeating symbols up to three times adds their values (e.g., III = 3).<br><br>2. A smaller numeral placed before a larger numeral indicates subtraction (e.g., IV = 4).<br><br>3. A smaller numeral placed after a larger numeral indicates addition (e.g., VI = 6).<br><br>Use examples to demonstrate these rules, such as XII = 12 or IX = 9.",
      "<b>Part 4: Guided Practice in Conversion</b>:<br><br>Work together as a class to convert simple Roman numerals to Arabic numerals.<br><br>Example 1: VII = 7<br>Example 2: XX = 20<br>Example 3: XL = 40<br><br>Reverse the process by converting Arabic numerals to Roman numerals.<br><br>Example 1: 15 = XV<br>Example 2: 29 = XXIX<br>Example 3: 49 = XLIX.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 Questions)</b>:<br><br>1. What is the value of VII?<br>2. How do you write 15 in Roman numerals?<br>3. What does IV represent?<br>4. Write 40 in Roman numerals.<br>5. What is the value of XX?<br>6. Write 29 in Roman numerals.<br>7. What does XLIX represent?<br>8. Convert XII to Arabic numerals.<br>9. How do you write 9 in Roman numerals?<br>10. What is the value of VI?"
