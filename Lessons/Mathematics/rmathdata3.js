            "<b>Part 1: Introduction & Warm-Up (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Number Song and Greeting Goal:To engage students and get them thinking about numbers in a fun, familiar way.<br><br>1. Gather the Class: Have the children sit in a circle on the carpet.<br>2. The Number Song: Start with a lively counting song. A perfect choice is 'Let's Count to 10' (to the tune of 'One, Two, Buckle My Shoe').<br>   · 'One, two, buckle my shoe.' (Children can act out buckling a shoe)<br>   · 'Three, four, knock at the door.' (Knock on the floor)<br>   · 'Five, six, pick up sticks.' (Pretend to pick up sticks)<br>   · 'Seven, eight, lay them straight.' (Use arms to make a straight line)<br>   · 'Nine, ten, a big fat hen!' (Flap arms like a hen)<br>3. Sing and Repeat: Sing the song twice. The first time, sing it slowly so everyone can join in. The second time, encourage the children to shout out the numbers.<br>4. Focus Question: Hold up your hands with all ten fingers spread out. Ask: 'Wow! How many fingers am I holding up? Can we count them together?' Lead a slow, deliberate count from 1 to 10, wiggling each finger as you say the number.",
            "<b>Part 2: Main Teaching (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Story Time - 'Ten Friendly Fish' Goal:To model counting and one-to-one correspondence in a contextual, engaging story.<br><br>1. Introduce the Book: Show the cover of 'Ten Friendly Fish'. Ask: 'What do you see on the cover? How many fish do you think are in this story?'<br>2. Interactive Reading: As you read each page, point to each fish individually.<br>   · 'Look! One friendly fish swimming by himself. Can you point to the one fish with me?'<br>   · On the next page: 'Now two friendly fish are waving their fins. Let's count them: One... Two!'<br>3. Student Participation: On pages with higher numbers (e.g., 5, 6, 7), ask for volunteers to come up and point to the fish as the class counts them together. This physically demonstrates one-to-one correspondence.<br>4. The Big Finish: When you get to the page with ten fish, do a big, celebratory count all together: 'We did it! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN FRIENDLY FISH!'",
            "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Number Mat Match Goal:To allow students to practice one-to-one correspondence with physical objects with teacher support.<br><br>1. Set Up: Place the large number cards (1-5 to start) on the floor in the middle of the circle. Place the basket of small objects (e.g., pom-poms) in the middle.<br>2. Explain the Game: 'We are going to be maths magicians! Our job is to put the right number of treasures on each number card.'<br>3. Demonstrate: Pick up the number '3' card. Say: 'This number is three. My job is to count out three treasures.' Slowly and deliberately place one pom-pom on the card, saying 'one'. Place a second, saying 'two'. Place a third, saying 'three'. 'I have three treasures for number three!'<br>4. Student Turn: Ask a student to pick a number card. Help them identify the number. 'Wow, you picked number four! Can you find four blocks to put on this card?' Guide them to count out each object as they place it.<br>5. Continue: Repeat with several students, using numbers 1-5. If the group is confident, introduce cards 6-10.",
            "<b>Part 4: Independent Practice & The Main Exercise (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Worksheet - Fill the Jars! Goal:To assess individual understanding of counting and matching quantities to numerals.<br><br>1. Transition: Children move to tables where a worksheet and a small cup of crayons/stickers are waiting.<br>2. Explain the Task: Show the worksheet on the board. It has jars labelled with numbers 1 to 5.<br>   · 'Look at these empty jars! They have numbers on them. This jar says '3'. That means it needs three things inside it.'<br>3. Demonstrate: On the board, draw three apples in the jar labelled '3'. 'One... two... three! Perfect!'<br>4. Student Task: 'Your job is to be the artist! Look at the number on the jar, and draw that many things inside it. They can be apples, balls, smiley faces, or anything you like! Just make sure you draw the correct number.'<br>5. Support: Circulate around the room. Ask guiding questions: 'What number is on that jar? How many have you drawn so far? Let's count them together.'<br>6. Extension: For fast finishers, encourage them to colour the jars or turn over their sheet and try drawing jars for numbers 6, 7, and 8.",
            "<b>Part 5: Plenary & Review (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Show and Tell Count Goal:To review the learning objectives and celebrate success.<br><br>1. Gather Attention: Bring the class back to the carpet.<br>2. Share Work: Hold up 2-3 completed worksheets. Ask the class to count the objects in the jar together. 'Let's check if this jar is full! Everyone, count with me: One, two, three, four! Yes, four for number four! Well done!'<br>3. Final Song: End with one final, energetic verse of the 'Let's Count to 10' song, celebrating all the brilliant counting they did today.<br>4. Positive Reinforcement: 'You were all amazing mathematicians today! You counted so well and filled those jars perfectly. Give yourselves a big pat on the back!'"

Gather the children on the carpet in a circle. Show them the jar filled with 20 items.<br>2. Ask: 'Good morning, Navigators! Look at this wonderful jar. I wonder, can we guess how many treasures are inside? Let's try counting them together!'<br>3. Start counting slowly as you pour the items out into a tray. Encourage the children to count with you.<br>4. As you approach 10, make it dramatic: '...eight, nine, ten! We've made it to ten! But look, there are more! What comes after ten?'<br>5. Gently guide them: 'That's right! Eleven! Let's keep going... eleven, twelve, thirteen...'<br>6. Continue all the way to twenty, pointing to each item as you count. Praise them enthusiastically for being such great counters!<br>7. Play the Song: 'You counted so well! Let's sing a song to practice.' Play 'Count to 20' by Super Simple Songs. Encourage them to use their fingers and do the actions.",
      "<b>Part 2: Main Teaching Input (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Goal: To introduce the concept that numbers 11-20 are '10 and some more'.<br><br>Activity: Making Groups of Ten<br><br>1. Hold up a 'Ten-Frame' mat or a pre-made stick of 10 cubes. 'This is a full ten-frame. It has 10 squares. Let's count them: 1, 2, 3...10!'<br>2. Place 4 loose buttons next to the ten-frame. 'And here I have 4 more buttons.'<br>3. Model the language: 'So, I have one whole group of ten... and four more. Ten and four more makes... fourteen!' Point to the number 14 on your poster.<br>4. Repeat this with another number, e.g., 17. 'Can you help me make seventeen? First, I need one group of...? (ten!). Good! Now, how many more do I need to make seventeen? Let's count on from ten: eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen! I need seven more!'<br>5. Involve the children: Ask a volunteer to come and place the seven extra items next to the ten-frame. 'Perfect! Ten and seven more makes seventeen!'",
      "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Goal: For students to practice making numbers 11-20 using the 'ten and some more' method with teacher support.<br><br>Activity: Number Table Tasks<br><br>1. Divide the children into small groups at tables.<br>2. On each table, place a ten-frame mat, a pot of loose objects, and a number card (e.g., 16).<br>3. Instructions: 'Look at your number card. Your job is to show that number on your ten-frame. First, fill up your ten-frame completely. That's your group of ten. Now, look at your number. How many more do you need? Count your extra ones and put them next to the frame.'<br>4. The teacher and any supporting adults move between tables, asking questions: 'What number are you making?' 'How many have you got in your group of ten?' 'How many extras do you have?' 'So, ten and six more makes...?'<br>5. After a few minutes, groups can swap their number card with another table and try again with a new number.",
      "<b>Part 4: Independent Activity & Consolidation (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Goal: To assess individual understanding of matching groups to numerals.<br><br>Activity: Cut and Stick Match-Up<br><br>1. Children sit at their tables. Give each child a worksheet.<br>2. Worksheet Description:<br>   · On the left side are pictures of groups of cute animals (e.g., bees, ladybirds) shown in a clear 'ten and some more' arrangement (e.g., 10 bees in a hive + 3 bees flying next to it).<br>   · On the right side are jumbled number cards from 11-20.<br>   · In the middle is a column of empty boxes.<br>3. Task: 'Look at the picture of the animals. Count them carefully. Remember to look for the group of ten first! When you know how many there are, find the right number on the right, cut it out, and stick it in the box next to the picture.'<br>4. The teacher circulates to provide support and observe who is confident with the counting and matching.",

      "<b>Part 5: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Share and Celebrate<br><br>1. Gather Back on the Carpet: Have a few students share their worksheet answers.<br>2. Quick Game: Hold up a number card (e.g., 15). Ask, 'Who can give me a number sentence that equals 15?' (e.g., '10+5!' '7+8!').<br>3. Reinforce Learning: 'Wow, Navigators! Look at what great adders you are! You can put groups together and find the total all the way up to 20. The Very Hungry Caterpillar would be so proud of your counting!'<br>4. Positive Reinforcement: Give lots of praise and maybe a class cheer like 'Hip hip hooray, we added today'"
