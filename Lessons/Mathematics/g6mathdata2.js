      "<b>Part 1: Introduction (Connecting Decimals and Percentages)</b>:<br><br>Begin with a quick recap:<br><br>Ask learners: “Who can remind us what percent means?” (Expected: per hundred)<br><br>Then ask: “What is a decimal?” (Expected: a number with a point showing part of a whole)<br><br>Explain:<br><br>Percentages and decimals are closely related.<br><br>To convert from decimal to percent, multiply by 100.<br>To convert from percent to decimal, divide by 100.<br><br>Write the formulas on the board:<br>Decimal × 100 = Percentage<br>Percentage ÷ 100 = Decimal",
      "<b>Part 2: Converting Decimals to Percentages</b>:<br><br>Explain with examples:<br>0.25 × 100 = 25%<br>0.5 × 100 = 50%<br>0.75 × 100 = 75%<br><br>Tell learners:<br>Move the decimal point two places to the right and add the % sign.<br><br>Practice examples together:<br>1. 0.6 = ?<br>2. 0.9 = ?<br>3. 0.01 = ?<br><br>(Answers: 60%, 90%, 1%)<br><br>Use a number line or chart to show how decimals grow into percentages.",
      "<b>Part 3: Converting Percentages to Decimals</b>:<br><br>Now reverse the process:<br>25% ÷ 100 = 0.25<br>10% ÷ 100 = 0.1<br>5% ÷ 100 = 0.05<br><br>Tell learners:<br>Move the decimal point two places to the left and remove the % sign.<br><br>Practice examples together:<br>1. 40% = ?<br>2. 80% = ?<br>3. 1% = ?<br><br>(Answers: 0.4, 0.8, 0.01)",
      "<b>Part 4: Real-World Application</b>:<br><br>Discuss where decimals and percentages are used together:<br><br>Shopping: A 0.2 discount is 20% off<br>Bank interest: 0.05 interest = 5%<br>Exams: 0.75 marks = 75%<br><br>Ask: “Why is it helpful to understand both forms?”<br><br>Use interactive money or shopping examples. For example:<br>“If you have K0.75, what percent of K1 is that?”",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Class Task)</b>:<br><br>A. Convert the following decimals to percentages:<br>1. 0.4<br>2. 0.05<br>3. 0.6<br>4. 0.01<br>5. 0.9<br><br>B. Convert the following percentages to decimals:<br>6. 25%<br>7. 50%<br>8. 10%<br>9. 5%<br>10. 100%<br><br>C. Word Problems:<br>11. A bank gives 0.08 interest on savings. What percent is this?<br>12. A shop advertises a 0.25 discount. What percent is this?<br>13. A battery shows 0.65 full. What percent is that?<br>14. A student got 0.95 of the total..."
