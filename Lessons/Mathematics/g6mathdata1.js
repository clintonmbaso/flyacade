      "<b>Part 2: Explanation of Ratio (15 minutes)</b><br><br><b>Definition:</b><br>A ratio is a comparison between two or more quantities. It shows how much of one thing there is compared to another.<br><br><b>Formula:</b><br>A ratio is written as a:b or a to b.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>1. If a class has 12 boys and 8 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is 12:8 or 3:2 (simplified by dividing both numbers by 4).<br>2. If you have 5 apples and 10 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 5:10 or 1:2.<br><br><b>Key points:</b><br>Ratios can be simplified by dividing both sides by the same number.<br>Ratios do not always mean the quantities will change together — they simply show a comparison.<br><br><b>Quick Practice:</b><br>What is the ratio of 4 red balls to 6 blue balls?<br>If there are 10 cats and 5 dogs, what is the ratio of cats to dogs?",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Time Tabling in Transportation</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Understand what a timetable is and why it is important in transportation (buses, trains).<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>A timetable is a chart or table that shows the times at which buses, trains, or other means of transport arrive and depart from various places. It helps passengers plan their journeys, ensuring they arrive at their destinations on time.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>- A school bus timetable shows when the bus picks up students and when it drops them off.<br>- A train timetable shows what time a train leaves each station and what time it arrives at the next.<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>- Why is a timetable important for passengers?<br>- What happens if a bus or train doesn't follow its timetable?",
      "<b>Part 2: Reading and Interpreting Timetables</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Learn how to read and understand a timetable.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>Timetables are usually organized in rows and columns.<br>- The first column shows the names of the stops or stations.<br>- The next columns show the times buses or trains arrive or leave each stop.<br>- Sometimes, timetables also mention if the service is daily or only on certain days (like weekdays or weekends).<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>A simple bus timetable:<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Let students read a timetable and answer simple questions like:<br>- 'What time does the bus leave City Center?'<br>- 'How long does it take to go from Bus Station to School Gate?'",
      "<b>Part 3: Understanding Fare Charts (Bus, Train)</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Introduce fare charts and how they work.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>A fare chart shows how much money passengers have to pay to travel from one place to another. Fares may depend on:<br>- The distance traveled.<br>- The type of ticket (one-way or return).<br>- The age of the passenger (children may pay less, while adults pay full price).<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>A simple bus fare chart:<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>- Why do you think traveling a longer distance costs more?<br>- How can someone save money on fares (like buying return tickets or monthly passes)?",
      "<b>Part 4: Solving Problems Using Timetables and Fare Charts</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Use timetables and fare charts to solve real-world math problems.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>1. <b>Time Calculation:</b><br>If a bus leaves Bus Station at 8:00 AM and arrives at School Gate at 8:30 AM, how long is the journey?<br><br>2. <b>Fare Calculation:</b><br>If a passenger travels from Bus Station to City Center and then from City Center to School Gate, how much do they pay in total?<br><br><b>Class Discussion:</b><br>- How can knowing both the time and fare help you plan a journey?",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br><b>Objective:</b><br>Understand what an open sentence is in mathematics.<br>Differentiate between open sentences, true sentences, and false sentences.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br>A sentence in mathematics is a statement that can be either true or false.<br>An open sentence is a mathematical statement that contains a variable and can be true or false depending on the value of the variable.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>True sentence: 3 + 2 = 5 (this is always true)<br>False sentence: 7 - 4 = 10 (this is always false)<br>Open sentence: x + 3 = 7 (this depends on the value of x — if x = 4, the sentence is true, but if x = 5, it is false.)<br><br><b>Why 'open'?</b><br>Because we don’t know the truth until we replace the variable with a value — the 'truth' is open until we solve it.",
      "<b>Part 2: Explanation (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br><b>Key Concepts:</b><br>1. Variable: A symbol, often a letter like x, y, or n, that represents an unknown value.<br><br>2. Linear equation in one variable: An equation like x + 3 = 7 where there is only one variable and the variable’s highest power is 1.<br><br>3. Open sentences in equations:<br>x + 5 = 9 → true if x = 4<br>2y = 8 → true if y = 4<br>a - 3 = 2 → true if a = 5<br><br><b>Formula for a basic linear equation:</b><br>ax + b = c<br>Where:<br>x is the variable.<br>a, b, and c are constants (numbers).",
      "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br><b>Activity:</b><br>Write these sentences on the board:<br>1. x + 2 = 6<br>2. 3y = 9<br>3. z - 4 = 10<br><br><b>Ask the class:</b><br>What are the variables?<br>Can we solve these equations to make the sentences true?<br><br><b>Solutions (step by step):</b><br>1. x + 2 = 6<br>Subtract 2 from both sides:<br>x = 6 - 2<br>x = 4 → true if x = 4.<br><br>2. 3y = 9<br>Divide both sides by 3:<br>y = 9 ÷ 3<br>y = 3 → true if y = 3.<br><br>3. z - 4 = 10<br>Add 4 to both sides:<br>z = 10 + 4<br>z = 14 → true if z = 14.",
      "<b>Part 4: Class Discussion (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br><b>Discuss:</b><br>Why are these open sentences? (Because they depend on the variable's value.)<br>What happens when we replace the variable with a number?<br>Can an open sentence ever be false? (Yes, if the value doesn’t satisfy the equation.)<br><br><b>Highlight:</b><br>An open sentence becomes true or false once a value is substituted for the variable.<br>Solving the equation means finding the value that makes the sentence true.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br><b>Solve the following open sentences by finding the value of the variable:</b><br>1. x + 4 = 9<br>2. 2y = 12<br>3. z - 5 = 8<br>4. 3a + 2 = 11<br>5. b ÷ 2 = 7<br><br><b>Homework (optional):</b><br>Create 3 open sentences using any variable and exchange with a friend to solve."

      "<b>Part 2: Explanation (15 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Steps to Solve Linear Equations:<br><br>1. Isolate the variable: Get x by itself on one side of the equation.<br><br>2.

      "<b>Part 4: Class Discussion (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Discussion Points:<br>Why do we use inverse operations?<br>Can a linear equation have more than one solution? (No, for simple equations like these, there is only one solution.)<br>What happens if both sides of the equation are already equal? (It means x can be any number — we call this an identity.)<br><br>Key takeaway:<br>Solving a linear equation means finding the exact value of x that makes the equation true.",
