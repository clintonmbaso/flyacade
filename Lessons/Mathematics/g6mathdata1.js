      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Decimal Numbers</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will understand what decimal numbers are and how they are written.<br><br>Explanation: A decimal number is a way of expressing numbers that are not whole.

      "<b>Part 2: Reading Decimal Numbers</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will learn how to read decimal numbers.<br><br>Explanation: To read a decimal number, read the whole number part first, then say 'point,' and then read the fractional part as individual digits.<br><br>Example:<br>4.67 is read as 'four point six seven.'<br>2.045 is read as 'two point zero four five.'<br><br>The important thing is to understand that the digits after the decimal point represent parts of a whole, not a separate whole number.<br><br>Tip: Decimal numbers are just another way of writing fractions in a simpler form.

      "<b>Part 4: Converting Between Fraction and Decimal</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will understand how fractions can be converted to decimal numbers.<br><br>Explanation: A fraction can be converted into a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Multiplying Decimals</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will learn how to multiply decimal numbers by decimal numbers.<br><br>Explanation: Multiplying decimals follows the same basic rules as multiplying whole numbers. However, after multiplying, you must count the total number of decimal places in both the numbers being multiplied and adjust the decimal point in the result accordingly.<br><br>Steps to Multiply Decimals:<br>1. Ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.<br>2. Count the total number of decimal places in both numbers being multiplied.<br>3. Place the decimal point in the product by counting from the right to the left, using the total number of decimal places from step 2.<br><br>Example: 0.6 × 0.4<br>Step 1: Multiply 6 × 4 = 24.<br>Step 2: There is 1 decimal place in each number, so the total decimal places are 2.<br>Step 3: Place the decimal point in the result, counting from the right. The result is 0.24.",
      "<b>Part 2: Multiplying Decimals with Different Decimal Places</b>:<br><br>Objective: Students will learn to multiply decimal numbers with varying numbers of decimal places.<br><br>Explanation: When multiplying decimal numbers with different decimal places, follow the same steps as before. The number of decimal places in the final result is equal to the sum of the decimal places in both numbers being multiplied.<br><br>Example: 0.72 × 0.5<br>Step 1: Multiply 72 × 5 = 360.<br>Step 2: The first number (0.72) has 2 decimal places, and the second number (0.5) has 1 decimal place. So the total number of decimal places is 3.<br>Step 3: Place the decimal point in the result, counting 3 places from the right. The result is 0.360.",

Let’s practice using decimals in word problems.<br><br>Example (Word Problem):<br>Sarah wants to buy 3.5 meters of fabric. Each meter costs 2.75 dollars. How much will Sarah spend on the fabric?<br>Step 1: Multiply 3.5 × 2.75.<br>Step 2: Multiply 35 × 275 = 9625.<br>Step 3: There is 1 decimal place in 3.5 and 2 decimal places in 2.75, so we have a total of 3 decimal places.<br>Step 4: Place the decimal point in the product, counting 3 places from the right. The result is 9.625 dollars.",
