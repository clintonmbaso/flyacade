      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Question Tags (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>What are Question Tags?<br>A question tag is a short question added to the end of a sentence.<br>It is used to confirm information or ask for agreement.<br><br>Example:<br>“It is a beautiful day, isn’t it?”<br>“You like ice cream, don’t you?”<br><br>Why do we use Question Tags?<br>- To check if something is true.<br>- To keep a conversation going.<br>- To make a statement sound more polite or friendly.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>Ask students if they have ever heard someone use question tags in a conversation.<br>Give more examples and ask students to repeat them.",
      "<b>Part 2: Rules for Forming Question Tags (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>1. If the sentence is positive, the question tag is negative.<br>Example: “She is your teacher, isn’t she?”<br>Example: “They are playing, aren’t they?”<br><br>2. If the sentence is negative, the question tag is positive.<br>Example: “He doesn’t like fish, does he?”<br>Example: “You haven’t finished your work, have you?”<br><br>3. Use the same helping (auxiliary) verb in the question tag as in the main sentence.<br>Example: “She can swim, can’t she?”<br>Example: “They should help us, shouldn’t they?”<br><br>4. If there is no auxiliary verb, use ‘do/does/did’ in the question tag.<br>Example: “You like chocolate, don’t you?”<br>Example: “He finished his homework, didn’t he?”",
      "<b>Part 3: Practice with Examples (10 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Activity: Fill in the missing question tag.<br>1. She is coming to the party, __________? (isn’t she?)<br>2. They aren’t ready yet, __________? (are they?)<br>3. You love reading books, __________? (don’t you?)<br>4. He didn’t eat his lunch, __________? (did he?)<br>5. We can go to the park, __________? (can’t we?)<br><br>Pair Work:<br>Divide students into pairs.<br>Each pair creates five sentences with question tags and asks each other.",
      "<b>Part 4: Common Mistakes & Corrections (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Mistake 1: Using the wrong auxiliary verb.<br>Incorrect: “She can play piano, isn’t she?”<br>Correct: “She can play piano, can’t she?”<br><br>Mistake 2: Using a positive tag after a positive sentence.<br>Incorrect: “He is your brother, is he?”<br>Correct: “He is your brother, isn’t he?”<br><br>Mistake 3: Forgetting the subject pronoun.<br>Incorrect: “You like ice cream, don’t like?”<br>Correct: “You like ice cream, don’t you?”",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (5 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>Write the correct question tag for the following sentences.<br>1. She is happy, __________?<br>2. They don’t have school tomorrow, __________?<br>3. You like football, __________?<br>4. He has a pet dog, __________?<br>5. We should go now, __________?<br><br>Bonus Challenge:<br>Write two sentences using question tags on your own."
