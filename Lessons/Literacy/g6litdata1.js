Suffixes that make adjectives:<br>- '-ful' → Full of something (hopeful, joyful).<br>- '-less' → Without something (careless, helpless).<br>- '-able' / '-ible' → Can be done (readable, visible).<br><br>3. Suffixes that make verbs:<br>- '-en' → To make something (darken, strengthen).<br>- '-ify' → To cause or make (beautify, simplify).<br><br>4.

Adding a suffix can change the word’s meaning:<br>- 'Help' (verb) → 'Helper' (noun, a person who helps).<br>- 'Happy' (adjective) → 'Happiness' (noun, the state of being happy).<br><br>2. Spelling rules when adding suffixes:<br>- If a word ends in '-e', drop the 'e' before adding a vowel suffix.<br>  Example: 'Hope' → 'Hopeful' (drop the 'e').<br>- If a word ends in a short vowel + consonant, double the last letter before adding a vowel suffix.<br>  Example: 'Run' → 'Running'.<br>- If a word ends in '-y', change it to '-i-' before adding a suffix (unless the suffix starts with 'i').<br>  Example: 'Happy' → 'Happiness' (change 'y' to 'i').",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Who vs. Whom</b>:<br><br>Start by asking students:<br>Who can tell me what 'who' means?<br>Have you ever heard the word 'whom' before?<br><br>Explain that both who and whom are question words or relative pronouns, but they are used in different situations.<br><br>Who is used when referring to the subject of a sentence.<br>Whom is used when referring to the object of a sentence.<br><br>Give simple examples:<br>Who is calling me? (The person doing the action)<br>Whom did you call? (The person receiving the action)",
      "<b>Part 2: Subject vs. Object Explanation</b>:<br><br>Break it down using subject and object roles:<br>A subject does the action.<br>An object receives the action.<br><br>Example sentences:<br>1. Who loves ice cream? (Who is the subject.)<br>2. To whom should I give the book? (Whom is the object.)<br><br>Introduce a trick:<br>If you can replace the word with he/she/they, use who.<br>If you can replace the word with him/her/them, use whom.<br><br>Example:<br>Who/Whom is knocking? → He is knocking. → Use Who.<br>You gave the book to who/whom? → You gave it to him. → Use Whom.",
      "<b>Part 3: Real-Life Application</b>:<br><br>Explain that whom is more formal and often replaced by who in everyday speech. However, in formal writing and grammar, using whom correctly is important.<br><br>Examples in different contexts:<br>Formal: To whom it may concern,<br>Informal: Who are you talking to? (Instead of To whom are you talking?)<br><br>Ask students to come up with sentences using who and whom.",
      "<b>Part 4: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Choose the correct word (Who or Whom) in each sentence.<br><br>1. _______ wrote this book?<br>2. To _______ should I address the letter?<br>3. _______ is coming to the party?<br>4. With _______ did you go to the mall?<br>5. _______ wants to volunteer for the project?<br><br><b>Bonus Challenge</b>: Ask students to create two sentences of their own—one using who and one using whom.",
      "<b>Part 5: Conclusion</b>:<br><br>Recap the key points and remind students of the subject-object trick. Encourage them to listen for who and whom in books and conversations."
