      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Greetings</b>:<br><br>Begin by asking students what they know about greetings. Explain that greetings are important because they are the first way we interact with others and set a friendly tone for the conversation.<br><br>Examples: Mention different greetings used at different times of the day:<br>Good Morning – Said in the morning when you see someone for the first time.<br>Good Afternoon – Said after 12:00 p.m. until the evening.<br>Good Evening – Said when meeting someone in the evening.",
      "<b>Part 2: When to Use Each Greeting</b>:<br><br>Good Morning: This greeting is used early in the day, typically before noon. It’s a way to show kindness when meeting someone at the start of the day.<br>Good Afternoon: Used after lunchtime (12:00 p.m.) until about 6:00 p.m. It’s a polite greeting when you see someone during the afternoon.<br>Good Evening: Used in the evening, generally after 6:00 p.m. It’s a respectful way to greet someone later in the day, especially before they go to bed.",
      "<b>Part 3: Tone and Body Language</b>:<br><br>Explain that greetings are not only about words but also about how we say them. A friendly tone, a smile, and good posture make greetings more effective.<br>Practice: Show students how to greet with a smile, maintaining eye contact, and saying the words with a warm tone. Discuss how it is important to be respectful and polite in your greetings.",
      "<b>Part 4: Cultural Context of Greetings</b>:<br><br>Explanation: Different cultures may have specific ways of greeting people. While “Good Morning” is common in English-speaking countries, in some places, people greet with a bow, handshake, or even a hug.<br>Activity: Discuss how greetings can vary in different countries. For example, in some cultures, it’s common to greet by shaking hands, while others may bow or exchange a kiss on the cheek.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Practice Greetings</b>:<br><br>Activity: Role Play: Have students pair up and practice greeting each other at different times of the day. One student can say “Good Morning” and the other responds. Then, have them do the same with “Good Afternoon” and “Good Evening.”<br><br>Objective: Students will practice using the appropriate greeting in context, paying attention to tone and body language.<br>Feedback: After each pair practices, give feedback on their tone, posture, and use of the greeting."
