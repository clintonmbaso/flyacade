      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Listening Comprehension</b>:<br><br>Begin with a class discussion: Ask students why listening is important in daily life (e.g., following instructions, understanding stories, learning new information).<br><br>Introduce phonological awareness: Explain that phonological awareness is the ability to recognize and manipulate sounds in spoken language. This helps with reading, pronunciation, and spelling.<br><br>Discuss key listening skills:<br>- Focus on the speaker.<br>- Listen for key words and ideas.<br>- Pay attention to pronunciation and intonation.",
      "<b>Part 2: Listening to the Passage</b>:<br><br>Read a six- to eight-sentence passage aloud (choose an engaging story or informational text). Example:<br><br>‘The sun was shining brightly as Tom walked to the market. He could hear birds singing in the trees. Suddenly, he saw a little puppy stuck in a fence. The puppy whimpered softly. Tom gently pulled the puppy out and gave it some water. The puppy wagged its tail happily, and Tom smiled.’<br><br>Read the passage twice:<br>- First reading: Students listen without taking notes.<br>- Second reading: Students focus on key details.",

What problem did Tom find?<br>4. How did Tom help?<br>5. How did the puppy react?<br><br>Phonological awareness activity:<br>- Ask students to identify words that rhyme (e.g., fence – whence, tree – see).<br>- Identify words with similar sounds (sun, sung, song).<br>- Clap syllables of words in the passage (puppy = pup-py).",
      "<b>Part 4: Aural/Oral Practice</b>:<br><br>Pair activity: One student reads a short sentence, and the other repeats it exactly as heard.<br><br>Pronunciation challenge: Have students repeat tricky words from the passage with correct pronunciation.<br><br>Dictation practice: Read one sentence from the passage, and students write it down from memory.",

  "activities": [
    ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Emphasis</b>:<br><br>What is Emphasis? Emphasis in communication means giving special importance or stress to a word, idea, or phrase to make it stand out. You can emphasize something by changing the tone of voice, repeating the word, or using it in a special way.<br><br>Examples of Emphasis:<br>I really want that ice cream! (The word 'really' emphasizes how much you want it.)<br>He is the best player, by far! (Here, 'by far' emphasizes the degree of the player's skill.)",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding Irony</b>:<br><br>What is Irony? Irony occurs when there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, or when someone says the opposite of what they mean, often for humorous or emphatic effect.<br><br>Examples of Irony:<br>A fire station burns down. (You would expect a fire station to be safe from fire.)<br>Saying, 'Great job!' when someone spills their drink. (You mean the opposite, suggesting it was not a good job.)",
      "<b>Part 3: Exploring Imitation</b>:<br><br>What is Imitation? Imitation is copying the actions, sounds, or behavior of others. In literature and speech, imitation often refers to mimicking the style or tone of another speaker or writer.<br><br>Examples of Imitation:<br>A child mimicking their parent’s way of speaking or walking.<br>A writer imitating the style of another writer, such as trying to write like Shakespeare or Mark Twain.",
      "<b>Part 4: Using Emphasis, Irony, and Imitation in Context</b>:<br><br>Now that we understand what emphasis, irony, and imitation are, we can use them in our own writing or speaking. These tools help make our language more powerful, interesting, and fun.<br><br>Examples in Context:<br>A speaker emphasizing key points during a presentation: 'This is the most important part!'<br>Irony in a story: A character prepares for a big test and says, 'I am going to fail this test for sure!' but ends up acing it.<br>Imitation in comedy: A comedian might imitate the actions and voice of a famous person to make their audience laugh.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Creative Expression Using Emphasis, Irony, and Imitation</b>:<br><br>Instructions:<br>1. Choose a Scenario: (e.g., a student who forgot to do their homework, a teacher giving an announcement, or a family dinner)<br>2. Write a Short Dialogue or Story: Use emphasis, irony, and imitation.
