      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Listening Comprehension</b>:<br><br>Begin with a class discussion: Ask students why listening is important in daily life (e.g., following instructions, understanding stories, learning new information).<br><br>Introduce phonological awareness: Explain that phonological awareness is the ability to recognize and manipulate sounds in spoken language. This helps with reading, pronunciation, and spelling.<br><br>Discuss key listening skills:<br>- Focus on the speaker.<br>- Listen for key words and ideas.<br>- Pay attention to pronunciation and intonation.",
      "<b>Part 2: Listening to the Passage</b>:<br><br>Read a six- to eight-sentence passage aloud (choose an engaging story or informational text). Example:<br><br>‘The sun was shining brightly as Tom walked to the market. He could hear birds singing in the trees. Suddenly, he saw a little puppy stuck in a fence. The puppy whimpered softly. Tom gently pulled the puppy out and gave it some water. The puppy wagged its tail happily, and Tom smiled.’<br><br>Read the passage twice:<br>- First reading: Students listen without taking notes.<br>- Second reading: Students focus on key details.",
      "<b>Part 3: Discussion and Phonological Awareness Activities</b>:<br><br>Discuss the passage with questions:<br>1. Where was Tom going?<br>2. What did he hear on his way?<br>3. What problem did Tom find?<br>4. How did Tom help?<br>5. How did the puppy react?<br><br>Phonological awareness activity:<br>- Ask students to identify words that rhyme (e.g., fence – whence, tree – see).<br>- Identify words with similar sounds (sun, sung, song).<br>- Clap syllables of words in the passage (puppy = pup-py).",
      "<b>Part 4: Aural/Oral Practice</b>:<br><br>Pair activity: One student reads a short sentence, and the other repeats it exactly as heard.<br><br>Pronunciation challenge: Have students repeat tricky words from the passage with correct pronunciation.<br><br>Dictation practice: Read one sentence from the passage, and students write it down from memory.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Listening Quiz</b>:<br><br>True or False Statements: (Students listen and respond)<br>1. Tom walked to the school. (False)<br>2. The puppy was stuck in a fence. (True)<br>3. The puppy barked loudly. (False)<br>4. Tom gave the puppy water. (True)<br>5. The puppy ran away. (False)<br><br>Sentence Completion: (Fill in the missing word)<br>The sun was _______ brightly. (shining)<br>Tom could hear _______ singing. (birds)<br>The puppy wagged its _______. (tail)."

Explain that asking for information is an important communication skill. We ask questions to learn new things, get directions, or clarify something we don’t understand.<br><br>Examples:<br>'Where is the library?' (Asking for location)<br>'What time does the movie start?' (Asking for time)<br>'Can you explain how to solve this math problem?' (Asking for an explanation)<br><br>Activity:<br>Pair students and have them discuss times they asked for information.
