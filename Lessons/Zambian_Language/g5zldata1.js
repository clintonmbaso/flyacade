  "activities": [
    ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Emphasis</b>:<br><br>What is Emphasis? Emphasis in communication means giving special importance or stress to a word, idea, or phrase to make it stand out. You can emphasize something by changing the tone of voice, repeating the word, or using it in a special way.<br><br>Examples of Emphasis:<br>I really want that ice cream! (The word 'really' emphasizes how much you want it.)<br>He is the best player, by far! (Here, 'by far' emphasizes the degree of the player's skill.)",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding Irony</b>:<br><br>What is Irony? Irony occurs when there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, or when someone says the opposite of what they mean, often for humorous or emphatic effect.<br><br>Examples of Irony:<br>A fire station burns down. (You would expect a fire station to be safe from fire.)<br>Saying, 'Great job!' when someone spills their drink. (You mean the opposite, suggesting it was not a good job.)",
      "<b>Part 3: Exploring Imitation</b>:<br><br>What is Imitation? Imitation is copying the actions, sounds, or behavior of others. In literature and speech, imitation often refers to mimicking the style or tone of another speaker or writer.<br><br>Examples of Imitation:<br>A child mimicking their parent’s way of speaking or walking.<br>A writer imitating the style of another writer, such as trying to write like Shakespeare or Mark Twain.",
      "<b>Part 4: Using Emphasis, Irony, and Imitation in Context</b>:<br><br>Now that we understand what emphasis, irony, and imitation are, we can use them in our own writing or speaking. These tools help make our language more powerful, interesting, and fun.<br><br>Examples in Context:<br>A speaker emphasizing key points during a presentation: 'This is the most important part!'<br>Irony in a story: A character prepares for a big test and says, 'I am going to fail this test for sure!' but ends up acing it.<br>Imitation in comedy: A comedian might imitate the actions and voice of a famous person to make their audience laugh.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Area, Mass, Weight, Capacity, and Height</b>:<br><br>Area: Area refers to the amount of space inside a shape or surface. It is measured in square units, such as square meters (m²) or square centimeters (cm²). For example, the area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:<br><br>Mass: Mass is the measure of how much matter is in an object. The common unit for mass is the kilogram (kg) or gram (g). For example, a book may have a mass of 500 grams.<br><br>Weight: Weight is the force exerted by gravity on an object, and it is often measured in newtons (N) or kilograms (kg). The weight of an object depends on its mass and the force of gravity acting upon it.<br><br>Capacity: Capacity is the amount of space inside a container or how much liquid a container can hold. It is typically measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). For example, a water bottle may have a capacity of 500 mL.<br><br>Height: Height refers to the measurement of how tall something is, often measured in meters (m) or centimeters (cm). For example, the height of a tree could be 3 meters.",
      "<b>Part 2: Units of Measurement and Conversion</b>:<br><br>Area Units: Square meters (m²) and square centimeters (cm²) are the primary units for measuring area.<br><br>Conversion: 1 m² = 10,000 cm².<br>Example: A rectangle with dimensions 2 meters by 3 meters has an area of 6 m² or 60,000 cm².<br><br>Mass Units: Kilograms (kg) and grams (g) are used for mass.<br><br>Conversion: 1 kg = 1,000 g.<br>Example: A package weighing 2 kg is equivalent to 2,000 g.<br><br>Weight Units: Weight is commonly measured in newtons (N), but for everyday use, kilograms (kg) are often used to describe weight in places where gravity is constant.<br>Example: A person weighing 50 kg would have a weight of 490 N on Earth, as weight is calculated by mass × gravity (9.8 m/s²).<br><br>Capacity Units: Liters (L) and milliliters (mL) are used for measuring liquids.<br><br>Conversion: 1 L = 1,000 mL.<br>Example: A bottle with a capacity of 2 L holds 2,000 mL of water.<br><br>Height Units: Meters (m) and centimeters (cm) are used for height.<br><br>Conversion: 1 m = 100 cm.<br>Example: A building with a height of 5 m is equivalent to 500 cm.",
      "<b>Part 3: Real-life Applications</b>:<br><br>Area: Example: To cover the floor of a room with tiles, we need to calculate the area of the floor. If the room is 4 meters long and 5 meters wide, the area would be:<br><br>Mass and Weight: Example: A sack of rice weighs 10 kg. If you were to lift it, you are essentially lifting the weight of 10 kg, which can also be described as the force exerted by gravity on the mass of the rice.<br><br>Capacity: Example: A jug can hold 2 liters of juice. If you pour 500 mL into the jug, you are adding half of the jug's capacity.<br><br>Height: Example: The height of a basketball hoop is 3 meters. You may compare it to the height of your classmates to understand relative heights.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practical Demonstrations</b>:<br><br>1. Measuring Area: Use a rectangular piece of paper or a book and measure its length and width. Multiply them to find the area in square centimeters or meters.<br><br>2. Weighing Objects: Bring a scale to class and weigh different objects such as books, bags, or fruits. Record the mass in grams or kilograms.<br><br>3. Capacity Exploration: Fill different containers with liquid and measure their capacity. Use a measuring cup to check how many milliliters or liters each container holds.<br><br>4. Height Comparison: Use a measuring tape to measure the height of various students in the class and compare them to objects around the room.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>1. Area Calculation: Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 7 meters and a width of 3 meters.<br><br>2. Mass Conversion: Convert the following: 500 grams to kilograms, 2.5 kg to grams.<br><br>3. Weight Calculation: If a person has a mass of 60 kg, what is their approximate weight on Earth in newtons?<br><br>4. Capacity Conversion: Convert the following: 3 liters to milliliters, 450 mL to liters.<br><br>5. Height Comparison: Measure the height of your desk and compare it to the height of your friend.
