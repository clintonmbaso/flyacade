      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Types of Questions</b>:<br><br>In this section, we will explain the three types of questions you can be asked about a story or play:<br><br>1. Surface Questions: These questions ask for information directly from the text. The answer is clear and easily found within the story. For example:<br>What is the name of the main character?<br>Where does the story take place?<br><br>2. Inference Questions: These questions require you to use clues from the text along with your own knowledge to draw conclusions. The answer is not directly stated, but can be understood by reading between the lines. For example:<br>Why do you think the character felt sad when they lost their book?<br>What might happen next in the story?<br><br>3. Vocabulary Questions: These questions ask you to understand and explain the meaning of certain words based on how they are used in the story. For example:<br>What does the word “reluctantly” mean in the sentence?<br>What is the meaning of “thrilled” based on the character’s reaction?",
      "<b>Part 2: Understanding the Story or Play</b>:<br><br>To answer questions correctly, it is important to first fully understand the story or play.<br><br>1. Read Carefully: Take your time to read the story or play, paying attention to the characters, setting, plot, and main ideas.<br><br>2. Identify Key Points: Look for important moments in the story that might be asked about later. For example, the main event, character actions, or changes in the setting.<br><br>3. Look for Clues: Inferences come from the hidden meanings in the text. Pay attention to emotions or actions that are not directly explained but can help you understand the characters and plot better.",
      "<b>Part 3: Answering Different Types of Questions</b>:<br><br>Here’s how to answer the three types of questions:<br><br>1. Surface Questions:<br>Go back to the text and look for the specific part that answers the question.<br>Be clear and direct in your response. For example, if asked, “Where did the story take place?” you can answer, “The story took place in a small village by the sea.”<br><br>2. Inference Questions:<br>Think about what the author is trying to communicate beyond the words on the page.<br>Use clues from the text and your own knowledge. For example, if the character is crying, you can infer that they are feeling sad or upset, even if it's not directly stated.<br>Form a reasoned guess about what the character might do next based on their emotions or behavior.<br><br>3. Vocabulary Questions:<br>Look at the context of the word in the sentence.<br>Think about what the word could mean based on the surrounding words or situation. For example, if the sentence says, “She was thrilled when she received the gift,” you can infer that “thrilled” means excited or happy.",
      "<b>Part 4: Class Discussion</b>:<br><br>Let’s now discuss as a class.<br><br>What did you notice when answering surface, inference, and vocabulary questions?<br>Can you think of any other examples of inference questions?<br>Why is it important to understand the meaning of words in the context of a story?<br><br>Let’s share some of your ideas and answers. This will help you get better at answering different types of questions in the future.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br><b>Activity: Answering Questions About a Story</b><br><br>1. Read the short passage below:<br><br>The sun was setting as Emma walked through the forest. She was tired from the long journey but felt a sense of excitement. Soon, she would reach the hidden cave her grandmother had told her about. As she approached the entrance, she could hear the rustling of leaves.<br><br>2. Answer the following questions:<br><br>1. Surface Question:<br>Where is Emma walking?<br><br>2. Inference Question:<br>Why do you think Emma is excited, even though she’s tired?<br><br>3. Vocabulary Question:<br>What does the word “rustling” mean in this context? What sound might it describe?<br><br>3. Group Discussion: After everyone has answered, we’ll discuss the answers together. Make sure to support your answers with evidence from the text!"

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to the Main Features of a Story or Play</b>:<br><br>Key Features of a Story/Play:<br>Plot: The sequence of events that make up the story. The plot typically involves a problem or conflict and how it is resolved.<br>Scenes: Different parts of a play or story that represent a shift in setting or action.<br>Characters: The people or creatures in the story or play, each with distinct roles.<br>Setting: The time and place where the story or play occurs.<br>Conflict: The central problem or struggle faced by the characters.<br>Resolution: How the conflict is resolved by the end of the story or play.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sequence of Events</b>:<br><br>Definition of Sequence:<br>Sequence refers to the order in which events happen in a story or play.<br>Stories and plays often follow a basic structure: Beginning (introduces the setting and characters), Middle (characters face challenges or conflicts), End (conflict is resolved).<br>Understanding the sequence helps in analyzing how the events build up to the climax and the final resolution.<br><br>Activity: Ask students to identify the sequence of events in a well-known story or play (such as a fairy tale or short play) by labeling the beginning, middle, and end.",
      "<b>Part 3: Understanding Scenes, Events, and Sub-themes</b>:<br><br>Scenes:<br>In plays, a scene is a division of the action. It represents a shift in time, location, or character interaction.<br>In stories, scenes can be understood as shifts in action that help move the plot forward.<br>Example: In a play, a scene might begin in a forest and end with the characters moving to a castle. Each scene shows a different part of the action or conflict.<br><br>Events:<br>Events are specific actions or occurrences that happen in the plot, often leading to a change in the story’s direction.<br>Example: In a story about a lost dog, an event could be when the dog finds a clue to its home.<br><br>Sub-themes:<br>Sub-themes are smaller ideas or messages that run parallel to the main theme. They can be important but may not be as central as the main theme.<br>Example: If the main theme is about bravery, a sub-theme might be about friendship or loyalty between the characters.",
      "<b>Part 4: Analyzing the Structure of a Story or Play</b>:<br><br>Now that we know the main features, sequence, scenes, events, and sub-themes, it’s time to analyze how they work together to tell the story.<br>Example: In a play, a character might face a challenge (conflict) in the first scene, but by the final scene, the character has learned something or changed (resolution). Sub-themes, like the character’s growth or relationships with others, often add depth to the story.<br><br>Activity: Read a short story or play excerpt. Ask students to:<br>Identify the sequence of events.<br>Break the text into scenes and events.<br>Identify any sub-themes present in the story or play.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>1.

Use exaggerated movements so students can easily identify what you are miming.<br><br>Discuss how miming is different from acting because the performer doesn’t speak; the focus is entirely on physical actions and expressions.",
      "<b>Part 2: Key Elements of Miming</b>:<br><br>Facial Expressions:<br>Teach students that facial expressions are critical in miming. Explain that expressions like smiling, frowning, or showing surprise can indicate different emotions and help the audience understand the mime’s message.<br><br>Have students practice simple emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger using only their faces.<br><br>Body Language:<br>Discuss how body movements like shrugging, gesturing, or walking in a particular way can convey different meanings. For example, miming someone carrying a heavy box requires the body to bend and lean to show the weight.<br><br>Demonstrate exaggerated body movements and have the students try miming basic actions such as running, jumping, or dancing.<br><br>Space Awareness:<br>Explain how to use space effectively in miming, as actions should appear as though the performer is interacting with an imaginary object or environment.<br><br>Show how you can mime actions that interact with an invisible wall, door, or object, and have students try this themselves.",
      "<b>Part 3: Practice and Refinement</b>:<br><br>Group Activity:<br>Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students.<br><br>Assign each group a word or short phrase (like 'brushing teeth,' 'driving a car,' or 'flying a kite') to mime in front of the class.<br><br>Encourage students to use both their facial expressions and body language to convey the word or action clearly.<br><br>Provide Feedback:<br>After each group performs, give constructive feedback on their facial expressions, body movements, and how clearly they conveyed the meaning without speaking.",
      "<b>Part 4: Watching and Analyzing a Mime Performance</b>:<br><br>Watch a Mime Video or Perform a Short Mime Scene:<br>Show a short video of a professional mime or perform a short mime scene yourself to demonstrate advanced miming techniques.<br><br>Ask students to identify what actions, expressions, and body movements were used to convey the scene or word.<br><br>Discuss how effective the mime was and why certain actions or expressions were particularly successful.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (20 minutes)</b>:<br><br>Mime Charades:<br>For this exercise, students will participate in a game of 'Mime Charades.'<br><br>Write down different actions or phrases on small pieces of paper (e.g., 'eating pizza,' 'climbing a ladder,' 'playing basketball') and place them in a bowl.<br><br>One student will pick a piece of paper and mime the action without speaking. The rest of the class will try to guess what they are miming.<br><br>After each guess, provide feedback on the use of gestures and facial expressions.<br><br>Rotate through different students so everyone has a turn miming and guessing."

Songs:</b> These are musical compositions with lyrics, often used to convey messages. A song typically has a rhyme scheme and a chorus that repeats.<br><br><b>Example:</b> A song about planting trees and how it benefits the environment.<br><br><b>2. Praises:</b> These are expressions of admiration or appreciation. In the context of environmental issues or food, praises could be short, repetitive phrases that celebrate the good things we should be doing.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Praising the efforts of farmers in producing food for the community.<br><br><b>3. Poems:</b> Poems are creative works of writing that express ideas or emotions, often in a structured form with stanzas and rhyme.<br><br><b>Example:</b> A poem about how waste harms the environment and how we can help prevent it.",

The teacher will break down the process into steps:<br><br><b>1. Choose a Crosscutting Issue:</b> Students will first choose a topic such as food, nutrition, or environmental conservation.<br><br><b>2. Brainstorm Ideas:</b> What message do you want to convey? How can the issue be presented positively or critically? (e.g., the benefits of eating vegetables, saving water, or reducing plastic waste).<br><br><b>3. Create Rhymes or Repetitive Phrases:</b> Rhymes make the song or poem more catchy and easier to remember.<br><br><b>4. Organize into Stanzas:</b> Structure your ideas into stanzas (groups of lines). A song might have a verse and a chorus, while a poem might have several stanzas.<br><br><b>5. Add a Message:</b> Whether it’s a call to action or an informative statement, ensure your composition communicates a clear message.",

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Debating</b>:<br><br>What is a Debate?<br>A debate is a formal discussion on a particular topic where two opposing sides argue for or against a particular point of view. Debates help develop critical thinking and communication skills.<br><br>Why Debate?<br>Debating teaches how to express opinions, listen to others, and think critically. It allows people to discuss important issues in a logical and structured way.<br><br>Types of Debates<br>Formal Debate: Involves specific rules and time limits for each side.<br>Informal Debate: More casual, with less structure but still focused on logic and respect for differing views.",
      "<b>Part 2: Key Elements of Debating</b>:<br><br>Vocabulary:<br>Use precise and appropriate words to express ideas. A strong vocabulary helps in making arguments clear and persuasive.<br>Examples: 'According to...', 'This clearly shows...', 'Research suggests...'<br><br>Voice Projection:<br>Speak clearly and at an appropriate volume so everyone in the audience can hear. A strong voice conveys confidence and authority.<br>Tip: Practice projecting your voice without shouting—use proper breathing techniques.<br><br>Clarity:<br>Make sure your ideas are expressed clearly. Avoid rambling or using overly complex sentences.<br>Tip: Organize your arguments into a clear structure—introduction, body, and conclusion.<br><br>Protocol:<br>Respect the rules of the debate, including taking turns speaking and listening to others. Show respect for opposing views, even if you disagree. Protocol also involves using formal language and addressing the audience and opponents appropriately.",
      "<b>Part 3: How to Structure Your Argument</b>:<br><br>Introduction:<br>Start by stating your position on the topic clearly.<br>Example: 'I believe that climate change is a critical issue that needs immediate action.'<br><br>Body:<br>Present your main points, backed by evidence such as facts, statistics, or expert opinions.<br>Example: 'Studies show that global temperatures have risen by 1 degree Celsius over the past century, which has contributed to extreme weather patterns.'<br><br>Counterarguments:<br>Address possible objections to your point of view and refute them logically.<br>Example: 'Some may argue that climate change is not caused by humans, but scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports human activity as the main cause.'<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Summarize your points and restate your position.<br>Example: 'In conclusion, it is clear that climate change is real and human actions are responsible for it. We must act now to reduce our carbon footprint.'",
      "<b>Part 4: Practicing Debate Protocol and Skills</b>:<br><br>Pair Students for Mini-Debates:<br>Students should pair up and take turns debating a topic, using the skills they’ve learned. Each debate should last 5-10 minutes.<br><br>Observe and Provide Feedback:<br>Encourage students to observe their peers’ debates, focusing on vocabulary, voice projection, clarity, and respect for protocol. After each debate, provide constructive feedback on what went well and what could be improved.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise (Debating Practice)</b>:<br><br>Objective: Practice debating on a current issue, focusing on vocabulary, voice projection, clarity, and protocol.<br><br>Instructions:<br>1. Choose a Debate Topic:<br>Select a current issue that is relevant and interesting to students. Example topics could include:<br>- Should school uniforms be mandatory?<br>- Is social media good for children?<br>- Should homework be banned?<br>- Should school start later in the day?<br><br>2. Preparation:<br>Spend 10 minutes preparing arguments. Each student should note their points and evidence to support their opinion.<br>Practice speaking clearly and projecting their voice.<br><br>3. Debate:<br>One student will argue for the topic (affirmative), while the other will argue against (negative).<br>Each student gets 3 minutes to present their argument. After both arguments, there will be a 2-minute rebuttal from each side.<br>Follow proper debate protocol: respect for speaking turns, listening to the opponent, and using formal language.<br><br>4. Feedback:<br>After each debate, classmates and the teacher will provide feedback focusing on the key elements: Vocabulary, Voice Projection, Clarity, and Protocol."
