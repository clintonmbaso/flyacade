      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Retelling Stories</b>:<br><br>Introduce the concept of story retelling. Explain the difference between traditional and modern stories. Traditional stories are often passed down through generations, like fairy tales or folktales, while modern stories are more current, such as books, movies, or stories from today's world. Discuss how when retelling a story, it is important to keep the key details intact while making sure the story is easy to follow and logical. Discuss coherence (making sure the events of the story are in order) and cohesion (connecting the sentences smoothly using linking words such as 'first,' 'next,' 'then,' and 'finally').<br><br>Ask the students to share examples of a favorite traditional story (e.g., Cinderella) and a modern story (e.g., a superhero story from a recent movie). Explain how stories are made of smaller parts (beginning, middle, end) and how to link these parts together to make the story flow logically.",
      "<b>Part 2: How to Retell a Story (Coherence and Cohesion)</b>:<br><br>Explain that a retelling includes the key elements of the story: characters, setting, problem, events, and resolution. These parts must be presented in a logical order. Provide an example by retelling a simple traditional story (e.g., 'Little Red Riding Hood') without using linking words and then with linking words. Without linking words: 'Little Red Riding Hood goes to the forest. The wolf eats her grandmother. She sees the wolf.' (This is unclear and doesn't flow well.) With linking words: 'First, Little Red Riding Hood goes to the forest. Then, the wolf eats her grandmother. After that, Little Red Riding Hood sees the wolf.' (This is much clearer and has a logical flow.)<br><br>Provide students with a short, simple story. Ask them to work in pairs and retell the story to each other using linking words to make it clear and easy to follow.",
      "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice: Retelling a Story Together</b>:<br><br>Choose a short, familiar story (such as 'The Three Little Pigs' or 'The Tortoise and the Hare'). Read the story aloud to the class. As you read, pause and discuss each part of the story. Ask the class questions like, 'What happened first?' 'What happens next?' 'How do the characters solve the problem?' Model how to retell the story by using linking words: 'First, the pigs build their houses. Then, the wolf comes and blows the houses down. Finally, the pigs build a strong house of bricks.'<br><br>After discussing the story, ask students to retell the story in small groups, making sure to use linking words to maintain the flow. Have each group share their retelling with the class.",
      "<b>Part 4: Independent Practice: Retell Your Own Story</b>:<br><br>Explain that now the students will retell a story of their own choice (traditional or modern) using coherence and cohesion. Remind them to use linking words and ensure their retelling has a logical sequence of events. Ask students to pick a traditional or modern story they know well and retell it in their own words. Encourage them to write it down if possible, ensuring they use linking words like 'first,' 'next,' 'then,' and 'finally.' Students should pay attention to making their retelling clear and logical. Once finished, students can share their retellings with a partner or the class.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Retelling with a Twist</b>:<br><br>Give students a traditional or modern story that is missing key events or has a mixed-up order (e.g., 'The Gingerbread Man' with scrambled events). Ask students to work in pairs to retell the story in the correct order using linking words.<br><br>Students will use the scrambled story and reorder it, making sure their retelling is coherent and cohesive. After retelling the story with their partner, they will share it with the class, focusing on how well they linked the parts of the story together."

  ],
  "assessments": [
    "<b>Observation</b>: Observe students during guided practice and independent practice to ensure they are using coherence and cohesion effectively in their retellings.",
    "<b>Exercise</b>: Evaluate the exercise where students reorder the scrambled story, checking for logical flow and clear use of linking words."
  ],
  "conclusion": [
    "Review the key concepts of coherence and cohesion in storytelling. Emphasize how important it is to have a clear and logical order when retelling stories, as well as how to use linking words to help the story flow."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Voice Projection</b>:<br><br>Objective: Understand the importance of voice projection in storytelling.<br>Begin by explaining that voice projection is about using your voice so that everyone in the room can hear you clearly without shouting.<br>Emphasize that good projection helps the audience stay interested and engaged in a story.<br>Demonstrate poor vs. good projection by reading a short sentence with a quiet voice and then with a loud, clear voice. Ask the class which version they found easier to hear and understand.<br>Discuss how effective voice projection adds emotion, excitement, and clarity to a story.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Science Behind Voice Projection</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to use your breath and body to project your voice.<br>Explain that voice projection involves using the diaphragm (a muscle beneath the lungs) to push air through the vocal cords, creating a strong, clear sound.<br>Teach the students the difference between speaking from their chest (which is louder and stronger) versus speaking from their throat (which can make their voice sound weak).<br>Show them how to stand or sit up straight to allow their diaphragm to work properly, and practice taking deep breaths before speaking to create a strong voice.<br>Discuss how speaking slowly and clearly, rather than too fast, helps others understand the story better.",
      "<b>Part 3: Using Your Voice for Expression</b>:<br><br>Objective: Use tone, pitch, and pace to add emotion to the story.<br>Explain how different emotions can be shown through changes in tone (happy, sad, scared, etc.).<br>Demonstrate how pitch (high vs. low) and pace (fast vs. slow) can be used to emphasize key parts of a story.<br>Ask students to practice saying a line in different emotions (happy, angry, surprised) while maintaining good projection.<br>Discuss how varying the tone, pitch, and pace in storytelling helps keep the audience’s attention and makes the story more interesting.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practicing Good Projection in Storytelling</b>:<br><br>Objective: Build confidence in using voice projection during storytelling.<br>Have students practice speaking clearly and loudly by reading a passage from a short story or poem.<br>Encourage them to use the skills they’ve learned: projecting from the diaphragm, using clear pronunciation, and varying their tone and pitch.<br>Pair students up and have them take turns telling a short story to each other, focusing on good voice projection. Provide feedback to help improve their technique.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Storytelling Performance</b>:<br><br>Objective: Apply voice projection techniques in a real storytelling scenario.<br>Each student will choose a short story or poem (or you can assign one) and practice telling it with good voice projection.<br>Ask them to focus on using clear, strong voices, as well as varying their tone, pitch, and pace to engage their audience.<br>After practicing, each student will perform their story in front of the class. The rest of the class should give feedback on how well they projected their voices and used expression.<br>For extra fun, you can ask students to act out parts of their story, using their body language and facial expressions to match the voice projection."
