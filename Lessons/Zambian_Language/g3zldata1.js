      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Retelling Stories</b>:<br><br>Introduce the concept of story retelling. Explain the difference between traditional and modern stories. Traditional stories are often passed down through generations, like fairy tales or folktales, while modern stories are more current, such as books, movies, or stories from today's world. Discuss how when retelling a story, it is important to keep the key details intact while making sure the story is easy to follow and logical. Discuss coherence (making sure the events of the story are in order) and cohesion (connecting the sentences smoothly using linking words such as 'first,' 'next,' 'then,' and 'finally').<br><br>Ask the students to share examples of a favorite traditional story (e.g., Cinderella) and a modern story (e.g., a superhero story from a recent movie). Explain how stories are made of smaller parts (beginning, middle, end) and how to link these parts together to make the story flow logically.",
      "<b>Part 2: How to Retell a Story (Coherence and Cohesion)</b>:<br><br>Explain that a retelling includes the key elements of the story: characters, setting, problem, events, and resolution. These parts must be presented in a logical order. Provide an example by retelling a simple traditional story (e.g., 'Little Red Riding Hood') without using linking words and then with linking words. Without linking words: 'Little Red Riding Hood goes to the forest. The wolf eats her grandmother. She sees the wolf.' (This is unclear and doesn't flow well.) With linking words: 'First, Little Red Riding Hood goes to the forest. Then, the wolf eats her grandmother. After that, Little Red Riding Hood sees the wolf.' (This is much clearer and has a logical flow.)<br><br>Provide students with a short, simple story. Ask them to work in pairs and retell the story to each other using linking words to make it clear and easy to follow.",
      "<b>Part 3: Guided Practice: Retelling a Story Together</b>:<br><br>Choose a short, familiar story (such as 'The Three Little Pigs' or 'The Tortoise and the Hare'). Read the story aloud to the class. As you read, pause and discuss each part of the story. Ask the class questions like, 'What happened first?' 'What happens next?' 'How do the characters solve the problem?' Model how to retell the story by using linking words: 'First, the pigs build their houses. Then, the wolf comes and blows the houses down. Finally, the pigs build a strong house of bricks.'<br><br>After discussing the story, ask students to retell the story in small groups, making sure to use linking words to maintain the flow. Have each group share their retelling with the class.",
      "<b>Part 4: Independent Practice: Retell Your Own Story</b>:<br><br>Explain that now the students will retell a story of their own choice (traditional or modern) using coherence and cohesion. Remind them to use linking words and ensure their retelling has a logical sequence of events. Ask students to pick a traditional or modern story they know well and retell it in their own words. Encourage them to write it down if possible, ensuring they use linking words like 'first,' 'next,' 'then,' and 'finally.' Students should pay attention to making their retelling clear and logical. Once finished, students can share their retellings with a partner or the class.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Retelling with a Twist</b>:<br><br>Give students a traditional or modern story that is missing key events or has a mixed-up order (e.g., 'The Gingerbread Man' with scrambled events). Ask students to work in pairs to retell the story in the correct order using linking words.<br><br>Students will use the scrambled story and reorder it, making sure their retelling is coherent and cohesive. After retelling the story with their partner, they will share it with the class, focusing on how well they linked the parts of the story together."

Ask the class which version they found easier to hear and understand.<br>Discuss how effective voice projection adds emotion, excitement, and clarity to a story.",
      "<b>Part 2: The Science Behind Voice Projection</b>:<br><br>Objective: Learn how to use your breath and body to project your voice.<br>Explain that voice projection involves using the diaphragm (a muscle beneath the lungs) to push air through the vocal cords, creating a strong, clear sound.<br>Teach the students the difference between speaking from their chest (which is louder and stronger) versus speaking from their throat (which can make their voice sound weak).<br>Show them how to stand or sit up straight to allow their diaphragm to work properly, and practice taking deep breaths before speaking to create a strong voice.<br>Discuss how speaking slowly and clearly, rather than too fast, helps others understand the story better.",
      "<b>Part 3: Using Your Voice for Expression</b>:<br><br>Objective: Use tone, pitch, and pace to add emotion to the story.<br>Explain how different emotions can be shown through changes in tone (happy, sad, scared, etc.).<br>Demonstrate how pitch (high vs. low) and pace (fast vs. slow) can be used to emphasize key parts of a story.<br>Ask students to practice saying a line in different emotions (happy, angry, surprised) while maintaining good projection.<br>Discuss how varying the tone, pitch, and pace in storytelling helps keep the audience’s attention and makes the story more interesting.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practicing Good Projection in Storytelling</b>:<br><br>Objective: Build confidence in using voice projection during storytelling.<br>Have students practice speaking clearly and loudly by reading a passage from a short story or poem.<br>Encourage them to use the skills they’ve learned: projecting from the diaphragm, using clear pronunciation, and varying their tone and pitch.<br>Pair students up and have them take turns telling a short story to each other, focusing on good voice projection. Provide feedback to help improve their technique.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Storytelling Performance</b>:<br><br>Objective: Apply voice projection techniques in a real storytelling scenario.<br>Each student will choose a short story or poem (or you can assign one) and practice telling it with good voice projection.<br>Ask them to focus on using clear, strong voices, as well as varying their tone, pitch, and pace to engage their audience.<br>After practicing, each student will perform their story in front of the class. The rest of the class should give feedback on how well they projected their voices and used expression.<br>For extra fun, you can ask students to act out parts of their story, using their body language and facial expressions to match the voice projection."

Provide a few prompts to guide their writing:<br><br>Describe the setting.<br>What does the sky look like?<br>What can you hear, see, or feel?<br>Are there any animals, plants, or people in the scene?<br><br>Writing Time:<br>Have students write a short paragraph describing a scenery scene using sensory details and the new vocabulary they’ve learned.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise – Scenery Description Sharing and Reflection</b>:<br><br>Sharing:<br>After students have finished writing, have them pair up with a classmate and share their descriptions. Ask each student to listen carefully and then describe what their partner’s scenery looks like to the class.<br><br>Class Discussion:<br>After sharing, discuss how different students used different details to describe the same type of scenery. Encourage them to think about how words can paint pictures in our minds.<br><br>Reflection:<br>Conclude the lesson by having students reflect on how sensory details and specific vocabulary helped to make their descriptions more vivid. Ask them to think of ways they can use these skills when describing other things, like people or events, in the future."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Describing Events</b>:<br><br>Begin by discussing what it means to describe an event. Explain that describing an event involves explaining what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. Give examples such as:<br><br>'Yesterday, I went to the park with my friend. We played soccer until it started raining.'<br>'At my birthday party, everyone sang songs and ate cake.'<br>Ask students to think about an event they remember and share a simple description.",
      "<b>Part 2: Sequencing Events</b>:<br><br>Explain the importance of organizing events in a logical order. Describe the idea of sequencing: First, Next, Then, Finally. Use a short story to demonstrate sequencing, for example:<br><br>First, we got to the zoo.<br>Next, we saw the elephants.<br>Then, we went to the monkey exhibit.<br>Finally, we had lunch at the zoo cafe.<br>Have the students practice sequencing events from their own experiences by guiding them through a few examples.",
      "<b>Part 3: Using Descriptive Language</b>:<br><br>Teach students how to make their event descriptions more interesting by adding adjectives (describing words) and adverbs (words that describe how actions are done). For example,<br><br>'We walked slowly through the dark, spooky forest.'<br>'The bright, colorful balloons floated in the air.'<br>Explain how these words help make the event feel more real and exciting. Ask students to describe their favorite place using adjectives and adverbs.",
      "<b>Part 4: Writing a Descriptive Event</b>:<br><br>Now, students will practice writing about an event. Start with an example event, such as 'A day at the beach,' and guide them through writing the event using sequencing and descriptive language. Write the following on the board as an example:<br><br>First, we arrived at the beach and saw the big, blue ocean.<br>Next, we put on sunscreen and played in the soft, warm sand.<br>Then, we swam in the cool water and watched the waves crash.<br>Finally, we had ice cream and watched the sunset.<br>Have students write a short paragraph about a memorable event in their life, following the sequence and using descriptive words.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Activity: Have students pair up and describe an event to each other using sequencing and descriptive language. After listening to each other’s descriptions, they should draw a picture of the event and write a few sentences about it. Encourage them to be as descriptive as possible with colors, sounds, and feelings.<br>Afterward, ask each student to share their picture and description with the class."

Lead (to guide) vs. Lead (a type of metal)<br>2. Tear (to rip) vs. Tear (a drop of liquid from the eye)<br>3. Read (present tense) vs. Read (past tense)<br><br>Discussion: Ask students to think of words they know that might have more than one meaning. Use the board to list some of these examples.",
      "<b>Part 2: How Homographs Work</b>:<br><br>Explanation: In homographs, the meaning of the word can change based on the context (what’s happening in the sentence). Sometimes, the pronunciation of the word changes too.<br><br>Examples:<br>'I will lead the group in our activity.' (pronounced /leed/)<br>'The pipe is made of lead.' (pronounced /led/)<br><br>Activity: Write a few sentences on the board with words that are homographs but are pronounced differently. For example: 'He will tear the paper.'<br>'She couldn’t stop the tear from falling.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Identifying Homographs in Context</b>:<br><br>Explanation: The meaning of homographs depends on how the word is used in a sentence. Pay attention to the rest of the sentence to understand how to pronounce and understand the word.<br><br>Example:<br>'The wind was very strong.' (Here, “wind” is a noun, pronounced /wɪnd/.)<br>'Please wind the clock before bed.' (Here, “wind” is a verb, pronounced /waɪnd/.)<br><br>Activity: Have students read sentences aloud that contain homographs. Ask them to decide which meaning of the word fits and how it should be pronounced.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practicing Homographs</b>:<br><br>Activity: Provide students with a list of homographs and sentences with missing words. Have them fill in the blanks with the correct word and then read the sentences aloud.<br><br>Example:<br>Sentence 1: 'I need to ______ the door.' (Answer: close)<br>Sentence 2: 'I saw the bird ______ above the tree.' (Answer: soar)<br><br>Discussion: Go over the answers with the class and emphasize how the meaning and pronunciation change.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise - Creating Sentences</b>:<br><br>Activity: Give students a worksheet with pairs of homographs. For each pair, they will write two sentences that use each word with its correct meaning and pronunciation.<br><br>Example pairs:<br>1. Bow (to bend forward) and Bow (a curved weapon)<br>2. Wind (moving air) and Wind (to twist or turn)<br><br>Extension: Students can work in pairs to compare their sentences and check for accuracy."

(Here, bow means bending forward.)<br>'He tied a red bow on the gift.' (In this case, bow means a knot or decoration.)<br><br>Let the students know that by looking at the other words in the sentence, they can figure out which meaning of the word is correct.",
      "<b>Part 4: Practice Using Homographs in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Give students a list of homographs and ask them to create sentences based on the different meanings. Here are a few to start with:<br><br>Light (not heavy / brightness)<br>Row (to paddle a boat / a line of things)<br>Park (a recreational area / to stop a car)<br><br>Encourage them to use their imagination and creativity when coming up with sentences.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Homograph Matching Game</b>:<br><br><b>Objective</b>: To reinforce understanding of homographs by identifying the correct meaning in different sentences.<br><br><b>Instructions:</b><br>1. Provide the students with a list of sentences. Each sentence will have a homograph, and students need to choose which meaning of the word fits best.<br><br>Example sentences:<br>'I can’t bear the noise anymore.' (Choose: bear = a large mammal / bear = to endure)<br>'He used a spring to bounce the ball.' (Choose: spring = a metal coil / spring = a season of the year)<br><br>2.
