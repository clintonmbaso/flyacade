      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Storytelling</b>:<br><br>Begin the lesson by explaining what a story is: A story is a narrative that can entertain, inform, or teach a lesson.<br><br>Discuss different types of stories: Explain that stories can be fictional (made-up) or non-fictional (real-life events).<br><br>Key Points to Cover:<br>Orderly manner: A good story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The beginning introduces the characters and setting, the middle develops the main events, and the end concludes the story.<br>Tense: Stories are told using different tenses. The past tense is most commonly used for traditional storytelling.<br>Example: 'Once upon a time, a boy found a magic stone.'<br>However, some stories might use the present tense for more immediate action or future tense for predictions or lessons.",
      "<b>Part 2: Tense and Story Structure</b>:<br><br>Explain how different tenses are used in stories:<br>Past Tense: Often used to tell events that have already happened. Example: 'The lion roared loudly.'<br>Present Tense: Can be used for stories that seem to be happening right now. Example: 'The hero steps forward.'<br>Future Tense: Often used in stories that talk about what might happen. Example: 'The girl will rescue the kingdom.'<br><br>Story Structure:<br>Introduction: This is where you introduce the characters, setting, and the initial situation. Example: 'In a faraway kingdom, there lived a young princess.'<br>Main Part: This is the bulk of the story where the conflict or events unfold. Example: 'One day, a dragon appeared and scared everyone.'<br>Conclusion: The story wraps up, and the conflict is resolved. Example: 'The princess bravely faced the dragon and saved the kingdom.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Vocabulary for Storytelling</b>:<br><br>Voice Projection: A storyteller should project their voice so everyone can hear. Encourage students to speak clearly and confidently, especially when presenting a part of the story. Practice speaking with different volumes.<br><br>Introduction, Main Part, Conclusion: Teach students the specific vocabulary they can use to describe these sections.<br>Introduction words: 'Once upon a time,' 'In a faraway land,' 'Long ago.'<br>Main part words: 'Suddenly,' 'Meanwhile,' 'At that moment.'<br>Conclusion words: 'Finally,' 'In the end,' 'And they all lived happily ever after.'",
      "<b>Part 4: Storytelling Practice</b>:<br><br>Group Activity: Divide the class into small groups. Ask each group to pick a story and retell it using the story structure discussed.<br>Encourage them to use appropriate tenses and to incorporate the vocabulary (introduction, main part, conclusion).<br>Remind them to project their voices while speaking, and take turns in narrating different sections of the story.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Create Your Own Story</b>:<br><br>Instructions: Ask students to create their own short story using the structure they learned.<br>Steps:<br>1. Introduction: Write a brief introduction for your story (where and when does it happen?).<br>2. Main Part: Write the main events (what happens to your characters?).<br>3. Conclusion: Conclude the story with an ending.<br>Story Sharing: After 10 minutes, ask volunteers to share their stories with the class.<br>As they share, encourage them to speak clearly and use voice projection. Also, check if they followed the order of events and used correct tenses."

    [
      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Synonyms</b>:<br><br>Definition:<br>A synonym is a word that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word.<br>Example: The synonym of 'happy' is 'joyful.'<br><br>Why Synonyms are Important:<br>Using synonyms in our writing makes it more engaging and helps avoid repetition. It also helps us choose the best word for what we want to express.",
      "<b>Part 2: Exploring Synonyms for Verbs</b>:<br><br>What is a Verb?<br>A verb is a word that shows action or being.<br>Examples of verbs: run, jump, talk, eat, sleep.<br><br>Examples of Synonyms for Verbs:<br>Run: sprint, jog, dash, race<br>Talk: speak, chat, converse, discuss<br>Eat: consume, devour, munch, nibble<br>Sleep: rest, doze, nap, slumber<br><br>How to Choose the Right Synonym:<br>Sometimes, a synonym might not fit perfectly depending on the sentence. For example, 'sprint' is a synonym of 'run,' but it suggests a faster or more intense action. Consider the context of the sentence when choosing synonyms.",
      "<b>Part 3: Using Synonyms in Sentences</b>:<br><br>Sentence Practice:<br>Let’s take the verb 'run' and practice using different synonyms in sentences:<br>'I like to run every morning.' → 'I like to jog every morning.'<br>'She will run to the store.' → 'She will dash to the store.'<br>'The athletes run in the race.' → 'The athletes sprint in the race.'<br><br>Have the students come up with their own examples using synonyms for verbs.",
      "<b>Part 4: Synonyms in Context</b>:<br><br>Context Matters:<br>Remind the students that some synonyms might change the meaning slightly based on context. For example, 'eat' and 'devour' both refer to consuming food, but 'devour' suggests eating quickly or greedily.<br><br>Interactive Exercise:<br>Read a short paragraph with a repeated verb. Ask the students to replace the verb with a suitable synonym.<br>Example Paragraph:<br>'Every day, Timmy runs to the park. He loves to run because it makes him feel free. Timmy runs faster than his friends.'<br>Ask students to rewrite this using synonyms for 'run.'",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Activity:<br>1. Write down 5 common verbs (e.g., jump, talk, play, see, work) on the board.<br>2. Have students write down at least 3 synonyms for each verb.<br>3. Afterward, ask students to create a short story using at least 5 different verbs and their synonyms.<br><br>Reflection:<br>Discuss with the class how using synonyms improved the quality of their sentences and made their writing more interesting. Encourage students to use synonyms in their future writing to enhance their vocabulary."

Ask them to pick one item from the box and write a creative description of it without revealing what the item is. For example, if the item is a rock, they might write: 'Smooth as glass and speckled with hints of silver, it feels heavy in my hand like a piece of forgotten history.'<br><br>Once all students have completed their descriptions, ask them to read their descriptions aloud.

The switch turns the fan on and off.<br><br>Discussion: Ask students if they have ever used scissors or a fan. Discuss the function of each part.",
      "<b>Part 4: How Machines Help Us</b>:<br><br>Each part of a machine has a specific job, but they all work together to perform a task efficiently. For example, in a bicycle, when you push the pedals, the wheels turn, and the bike moves forward. The brakes help you stop when needed. Machines save time and energy and help us do jobs more easily.",

Discuss how certain words or behaviors are appropriate in some places but might be rude or uncomfortable in others. Ask students to think about different places they visit (like the market, hospital, or funeral) and what kind of language would be appropriate there. Examples: At the market, polite language includes saying 'Excuse me,' 'Please,' 'Thank you,' or 'How much is this?' In a hospital, it is important to speak calmly and respectfully, saying things like 'May I speak with the doctor?' or 'I hope you feel better.' At a funeral, the language should be respectful and quiet, like 'I'm so sorry for your loss,' or 'My condolences.'",

Hospital: 'Excuse me, where can I find the nurse?' 'I feel unwell.' 'I need help, please.' Funeral: 'I’m very sorry for your loss.' 'May your soul rest in peace.' 'We’re here to support you.'",
      "<b>Part 3: Understanding Context and Tone</b>:<br><br>Teach students that the tone of voice and body language should match the situation. For example, in the hospital, a calm and soft voice is necessary, whereas at the market, a louder, more energetic voice can be used. Discuss how to observe the mood and setting before speaking. For example, in a funeral, the tone should be quiet and somber, while in a market, it can be more cheerful and energetic. Demonstration: Show how the same sentence can sound different based on tone. For instance: 'Excuse me, can I get this?' (spoken with a polite tone) vs. 'Excuse me, can I get this?' (spoken rudely or impatiently).",
      "<b>Part 4: Role-playing Social Situations</b>:<br><br>Divide students into small groups and give each group a situation (e.g., at the market, hospital, or funeral). Ask each group to act out a short skit demonstrating the appropriate language and behavior for that situation. Encourage students to use polite phrases, appropriate tone, and body language during the role-play. After each skit, have a brief discussion on how the language used was appropriate or could be improved.",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise: Language Matching</b>:<br><br>Provide students with a worksheet that contains two columns. One column has different situations (market, hospital, funeral), and the other column has different phrases. The students’ task is to match the phrases with the correct situation. Example: Situation: Market. Phrases: 'Can I get this, please?' / 'I’m sorry for your loss.' Correct match: 'Can I get this, please?' for Market."

      "<b>Part 1: Introduction to Rational Thinking</b>:<br><br>Definition:<br>Rational thinking means thinking in a clear, logical way that makes sense.<br>It involves analyzing a situation, understanding the facts, and drawing conclusions based on evidence.<br><br>Key points:<br>Logic: The process of reasoning consistently.<br>Evidence: Using facts, examples, or proof to support ideas.<br>Reasoning: The ability to think carefully and form judgments.<br><br>Activity:<br>Group discussion: Ask students to think about a simple situation, like whether it’s a good idea to study for a test the day before or a week before. Guide them to think about the logical reasons for both choices and help them identify which one makes more sense.",
      "<b>Part 2: How to Express Rational Thoughts</b>:<br><br>Steps for expressing rational thoughts:<br>1. State the main idea: Start by clearly stating your main thought or opinion.<br>2. Give reasons: Provide logical reasons to support your opinion.<br>3. Use examples or evidence: Support your reasons with facts or examples.<br>4. Draw a conclusion: Finish by summarizing your point of view.<br><br>Example:<br>“I believe it’s better to study for the test a week before because it gives me more time to review the material, and I can ask questions if I don’t understand something.”",
      "<b>Part 3: Identifying Rational and Irrational Thoughts</b>:<br><br>What is irrational thinking?<br>Irrational thoughts are unreasonable or based on false information. They lack logical reasoning.<br><br>Example of irrational thinking:<br>“I shouldn’t study at all because I always fail tests anyway.” This is irrational because it doesn’t consider the possibility of success with proper study.<br><br>Activity:<br>Provide students with a list of statements and have them identify whether each statement is rational or irrational. For example:<br>1. 'I should study every day to get better at math.' (Rational)<br>2. 'I won’t try out for the play because I’m too shy.' (Irrational)",
      "<b>Part 4: Practicing Rational Thinking</b>:<br><br>How to Practice Rational Thinking:<br>1. Look at the facts before making a decision.<br>2. Avoid jumping to conclusions based on emotions or assumptions.<br>3. Consider other people’s opinions and use them to help you reason logically.<br><br>Example Activity:<br>Present students with a situation like: “You have a group project to complete. One group member hasn’t done their part. What should you do?”<br>Rational response: 'I will talk to my group member, ask if they need help, and then decide how to handle the situation.'<br>Irrational response: 'I will do the whole project myself because my group member is lazy.'",
      "<b>Part 5: Exercise</b>:<br><br>Rational Thinking Exercise:<br>1. Scenario 1:<br>Your friend wants to buy a toy, but you think it's too expensive. What would be a rational way to respond?<br>Write a short paragraph expressing your thoughts logically, considering both sides of the situation.<br>2. Scenario 2:<br>You are deciding whether to join a sports team. Some of your friends say you should, but you are not sure. How can you make a rational decision?<br>Write down at least three reasons for and against joining, then conclude with your decision and explain why."
