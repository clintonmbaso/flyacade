They were shocked to find a group of rats and mice living inside. The cats were angry and saw the rodents as easy prey. Shaggy quickly came up with a plan. Instead of running, the rodents prepared a delicious feast for the cats. The wonderful smell filled the shed, and the cats decided to eat instead of chase the rodents.
