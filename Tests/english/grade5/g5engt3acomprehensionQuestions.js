He could hide inside when he felt scared or wanted to rest. Inside his shell, Sammy had everything he needed: a soft spot to sleep and a place to keep his food. He loved curling up inside, feeling snug and warm.</p><p>Every morning, Sammy would slowly slide out of his shell to explore the garden. He enjoyed the soft, dewy grass and the colorful flowers. Sammy liked to move slowly so he could look at everything around him. He would carefully watch the tiny bugs and listen to the birds singing.</p><p>Sammy knew that his shell was very special. It helped him stay safe from other animals that might want to hurt him. He would always return to his shell at night or when it rained.
