He would help save the Israelites from their enemies, the Philistines. The angel told the woman not to drink wine or eat anything unclean, and never to cut the boy’s hair. His hair would be a sign that he belonged to God.</p><p>The woman ran to tell her husband, Manoah. He was amazed and prayed to God to send the angel again.
