            <p>Welcome to Week 3 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we are going outside to learn how to play safely together.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's go to the playground or play area. Why do we need rules when we play games? Rules help everyone have fun and stay safe!</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Time:</strong> Let's look at the play equipment—swings, slides, or open space. We will look for things that might not be safe, like loose stones or broken equipment.</p>
            <p><strong>Playground Laws:</strong> Today we will make our own "Playground Laws":</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No pushing.</strong> - Keep your hands to yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Wait your turn.</strong> - Be patient and fair.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay within the boundary lines.</strong> - Play where it's safe.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Practice Time:</strong> We will play a game where everyone must take turns and keep a safe distance from others who are running.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Following rules helps us enjoy playtime without getting hurt and makes sure everyone feels happy and included.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Before we go back inside, let's check the area to make sure no toys or equipment were left out for someone to trip over.</p>

                <p>Look at the slide. Is the ladder broken? Is the ground underneath soft? We only play on safe equipment!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we are learning how to stay safe near roads. Roads help us travel, but we must be careful!</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> How did you get to school today? Did you walk near a road? We must always be visible and alert when near traffic.</p>
            <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> We will learn the "Look Listen Live" sequence:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stop</strong> at the edge of the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Look right</strong> for cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Look left</strong> for cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Look right again</strong> because cars come fast!</li>
                <li><strong>Listen</strong> for engines or horns.</li>
                <li>If it's clear, walk straight across—don't run!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Simulation:</strong> We will use masking tape to make a "road" on the classroom floor. You will practice stopping at the edge and looking both ways before crossing.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Why is it important to walk on the pavement/sidewalk? Why should we hold an adult’s hand near roads?</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Let's have a quick quiz: What is the first thing you do before stepping onto a road?</p>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Knowing how to cross safely protects us and helps us become responsible pedestrians.</p>
