            <p>Welcome to Week 9! Today we are going to discover the amazing world of hand tools. These tools help us make and build things!</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's look at some safe hand tools. What are they called? Why do people use them?</p>
            <p><strong>Hand Tools We'll Learn About:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Knife</strong> - For cutting and shaping</li>
                <li><strong>Adze</strong> - For carving wood</li>
                <li><strong>Saw</strong> - For cutting wood</li>
                <li><strong>Hammer</strong> - For pounding nails</li>
                <li><strong>Screwdriver</strong> - For turning screws</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What Are Hand Tools?</strong> Hand tools are extensions of our hands that help us make things. They give us more power and precision!</p>
            <p><strong>Matching Game:</strong> I'll describe a task, and you tell me which tool we should use.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Knowing about tools helps us become makers and creators. We can build toys, fix things, and make art!</p>

            <p>Today we become makers! We'll use simple tools to create our own toys.</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> Let's remember the tools we learned about on Tuesday. Which tool helps us cut? Which helps us shape?</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Today you will be "makers" using your hands and simple tools. We'll make something special!</p>
            <p><strong>Safety First!</strong> The most important rule when using tools:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Always cut <strong>away</strong> from your body</li>
                <li>Hold tools firmly with both hands if needed</li>
                <li>Use tools only for their purpose</li>
                <li>Walk carefully when carrying tools</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Today's Project:</strong> We'll use soft materials to make simple toys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clay or playdough for shaping</li>
                <li>Soft cardboard for cutting</li>
                <li>Plastic modeling knives or popsicle sticks as tools</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Toy Ideas:</strong> Small car, animal figurine, house, or anything you imagine!</p>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Making things with tools teaches us patience, creativity, and safety. We learn that we can create what we imagine!</p>
