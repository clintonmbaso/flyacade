            <p>Welcome to our Community Helpers week! Today we will learn about two very important people who help us learn and stay healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Let's think about:</strong> Who helped you learn to write your name? Who looks after you when you have a fever?</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Community Helpers:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Teacher</strong> - Helps us learn new things like reading, writing, and numbers</li>
                <li><strong>Nurse</strong> - Takes care of us when we are sick or hurt</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Where do they work?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teachers work in classrooms and schools</li>
                <li>Nurses work in clinics, hospitals, and sometimes in schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are they important?</strong> Teachers help our brains grow strong, and nurses help our bodies stay healthy!</p>
