            <p>Welcome to our week all about asking sentences! Today we will learn how to spot sentences that ask questions.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> An asking sentence is a sentence that asks something. It ends with a special punctuation mark called a <strong>question mark (?).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What Makes an Asking Sentence:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It asks something</li>
                <li>It starts with a capital letter</li>
                <li>It ends with a question mark (?)</li>
                <li>It often starts with words like: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are asking sentences important?</strong> We use asking sentences every day to learn new things, find information, and show curiosity about the world around us!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to write our own asking sentences! Remember the three important rules for writing asking sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>The Three Rules for Writing Asking Sentences:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with a capital letter</strong> - The first word always begins with a capital letter</li>
                <li><strong>Ask a question</strong> - Your sentence should ask something</li>
                <li><strong>End with a question mark (?)</strong> - Always put a question mark at the end</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Question Starters:</strong> Many asking sentences begin with special words that help us ask questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who</strong> - asks about people (Who is your friend?)</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> - asks about things (What is that?)</li>
                <li><strong>Where</strong> - asks about places (Where is school?)</li>
                <li><strong>When</strong> - asks about time (When is lunch?)</li>
                <li><strong>Why</strong> - asks for reasons (Why is the sky blue?)</li>
                <li><strong>How</strong> - asks about ways (How do you spell cat?)</li>

            <p>Today we will learn about two different types of sentences: telling sentences and asking sentences. Knowing the difference helps us write and read better!</p>
            <p><strong>Telling Sentences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tell us something</li>
                <li>Start with a capital letter</li>

                <li><strong>Ending Marks:</strong> Telling sentences end with periods (.). Asking sentences end with question marks (?).</li>
                <li><strong>Voice:</strong> When we read telling sentences, our voice goes down. When we read asking sentences, our voice goes up at the end.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>All sentences start with capital letters</li>
                <li>Telling sentences end with periods</li>
                <li>Asking sentences end with question marks</li>
                <li>Punctuation helps readers understand what kind of sentence it is</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Knowing the difference helps you become a better reader and writer. You'll understand stories better and write clearer sentences!</p>
