            <p>Welcome to Week 7 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will practice our observation and drawing skills by looking at objects right here in our classroom.</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Time:</strong> Look around the classroom. What objects do you see? Today we will choose one object to draw exactly as we see it.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Focus:</strong> Drawing objects like chairs, cups, or other items found in our school.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Drawing what we see helps us become better observers and improves our hand-eye coordination. It’s the first step to becoming a great artist!</p>
            <p><strong>Steps for Today:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Object:</strong> Pick one object you can see clearly from where you sit.</li>
                <li><strong>Look Carefully:</strong> Notice its shape, size, and details.</li>
                <li><strong>Draw What You See:</strong> Try to draw it exactly as it appears.</li>
                <li><strong>Fill Your Page:</strong> Use the whole paper to make your drawing big and clear.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Today we will use our memory and imagination to draw objects from our homes. You all see different things every day—let’s put them on paper!</p>
            <p><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Let’s share! What is your favorite pot at home? Does anyone have a special money box or piggy bank? Describe them to the class.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Focus:</strong> Drawing household objects like pots, money boxes, cups, or utensils.</p>
            <p><strong>Guided Drawing:</strong> Many household objects have round shapes. Let’s practice drawing circles and ovals—these are the bases for pots, bowls, and money boxes.</p>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Drawing from memory helps us remember details and express our personal experiences. It also makes our artwork unique!</p>
            <p><strong>Steps for Today:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Remember Your Object:</strong> Think of a pot, money box, or other item from home.</li>
                <li><strong>Start with Shapes:</strong> Draw the main shape first (circle, oval, rectangle).</li>
                <li><strong>Add Details:</strong> Include handles, patterns, lids, or decorations.</li>
                <li><strong>Make It Yours:</strong> Add colors or designs that make it special to you.</li>
