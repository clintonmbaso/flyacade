            <p>Welcome to our lesson on pronouns! Today we will learn about special words that can take the place of other words in sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Pronouns are words that replace nouns in sentences. They help us avoid repeating the same words over and over.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Pronouns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I, me</li>
                <li>you</li>
                <li>he, him</li>
                <li>she, her</li>
                <li>it</li>
                <li>we, us</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why do we use pronouns?</strong> Pronouns make our sentences shorter and easier to say and write. Instead of repeating someone's name, we can use a pronoun!</p>

                <li>We use different pronouns for different situations</li>

            <p><strong>Pronoun Rules to Remember:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use "I" when you are talking about yourself</li>
                <li>Use "he" for a boy, "she" for a girl, "it" for a thing or animal</li>
                <li>Use "they" and "them" for groups</li>
                <li>Make sure the pronoun matches the noun it replaces</li>
