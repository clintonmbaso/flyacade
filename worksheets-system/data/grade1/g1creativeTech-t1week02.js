            <p>Welcome to Week 2 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to keep ourselves and our classmates safe in the classroom.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's look around our classroom. What things could be dangerous if we are not careful? Think about sharp corners, scissors, or water on the floor.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> A clean room is a safe room! We need to make sure our classroom is tidy and organized to prevent accidents.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Safety Rules:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Keep walkways clear</strong> - Don't leave bags or books where people walk.</li>
                <li><strong>Store materials safely</strong> - Put scissors and pencils away properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean up spills</strong> - Tell a teacher if you see water or other liquids on the floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Carry materials carefully</strong> - Always hold scissors with points down.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When our classroom is clean and organized, we can learn better and avoid getting hurt!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about safety in special rooms around our school, like the computer lab, kitchen, or workshop.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Some rooms in our school have special equipment that needs special safety rules. We must be extra careful in these rooms!</p>
            <p><strong>Special Room Safety Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No running</strong> - Always walk slowly and carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep hands to yourself</strong> - Don't touch equipment without permission.</li>
                <li><strong>No water near machines</strong> - Liquids and electricity don't mix!</li>
                <li><strong>Never touch plugs or wires</strong> - This is very important for electrical safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Adult supervision always</strong> - Never enter a specialised room without a teacher.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are these rules important?</strong> Special rooms have equipment that can be dangerous if not used properly. Following rules keeps everyone safe!</p>
