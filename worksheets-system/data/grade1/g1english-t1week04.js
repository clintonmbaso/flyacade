            <p>Welcome to our lesson on question sentences! Today we will learn about sentences that ask something.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> A question sentence is a sentence that asks something. It usually begins with a question word like "who," "what," "where," "when," "why," or "how."</p>
            <p><strong>What Question Sentences Do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask for information</li>
                <li>Usually begin with a capital letter</li>
                <li>End with a question mark (?)</li>
                <li>Often start with question words</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are question sentences important?</strong> We use question sentences every day to learn new things, to get information, and to understand the world around us!</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Who:</strong> asks about a person (Who is that?)</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> asks about a thing (What is this?)</li>

                <li><strong>When:</strong> asks about time (When is lunch?)</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> asks for a reason (Why is the sky blue?)</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> asks about manner (How do you feel?)</li>
