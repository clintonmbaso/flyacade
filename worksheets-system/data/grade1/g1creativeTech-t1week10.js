            <p>Welcome to Week 10 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn about the tools we use every day to eat and drink.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What did you use to eat breakfast this morning? Did you use a spoon? A plate? A cup? These are called <strong>kitchen utensils</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Let's Look at Some Kitchen Utensils:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lunchbox:</strong> Keeps our food safe and fresh</li>
                <li><strong>Plate:</strong> Holds our food so it doesn't fall</li>
                <li><strong>Spoon:</strong> Helps us scoop food like rice or soup</li>
                <li><strong>Drinking Bottle:</strong> Holds our drink without spilling</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Using the right tool helps us eat neatly, stay healthy, and enjoy our meals!</p>
            <p><strong>Expected Standard:</strong> We will practice how to hold a spoon correctly and how to open and close a lunchbox without spilling.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to take care of our kitchen utensils so they last longer and keep us healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What happens if we leave a plate with food on it for a long time? It gets dirty and can make us sick. That's why we clean our tools!</p>
            <p><strong>Why Clean Our Utensils?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeps us healthy by removing germs</li>
                <li>Makes our tools last longer</li>
                <li>Keeps food tasting fresh</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Cleaning Rule:</strong> <strong>"Use it, Clean it, Put it away."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>How to Clean:</strong> We wipe down lunchboxes and plates with water (or pretend to). We dry them well so they don't get moldy.</p>
            <p><strong>Suitable Storage Places:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Spoons go in a drawer or utensil holder</li>
                <li>Lunchboxes go in a cupboard or backpack</li>
                <li>Plates go on a shelf or in a dish rack</li>
                <li>Bottles go upright in a cabinet</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Pair Work:</strong> You'll work with a friend to practice cleaning and putting away pretend utensils.</p>
