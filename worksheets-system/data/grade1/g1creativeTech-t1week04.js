            <p>Welcome to Creative and Technology Studies! This week we are learning about our bodies and how to hold them in healthy ways.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Posture?</strong> Posture is how we hold our bodies when we sit, stand, or move. Good posture helps us feel strong and ready to learn!</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion Time:</strong> Let's talk about how we sit when we're tired versus how we sit when we're ready to learn. How do they feel different?</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Key Postures:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mountain Pose (Standing):</strong> Feet flat on the ground, shoulders back, head held high like a tall mountain.</li>
                <li><strong>Scholar Pose (Sitting):</strong> Back straight against the chair, feet flat on the floor, ready to learn like a wise scholar.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Good posture helps us breathe better, feel more alert, and keeps our bodies healthy and strong!</p>

            <p>Today we learn how to move our bodies carefully and safely in different activities!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Movements We'll Practice:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lifting Safely:</strong> Bend your knees, not your back, when picking something up.</li>
                <li><strong>Walking Smoothly:</strong> Walk with your head up, shoulders back, and smooth steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Kneeling Properly:</strong> Kneel gently using one knee, then the other, and stand up using your leg muscles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Move with Care?</strong> Moving correctly keeps our bodies safe, prevents injuries, and helps us feel balanced and strong!</p>
            <p><strong>Group Activity:</strong> You'll work with a partner to practice kneeling and lifting safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Fun Challenge:</strong> We'll create a mini "obstacle course" to practice walking with perfect posture!</p>
