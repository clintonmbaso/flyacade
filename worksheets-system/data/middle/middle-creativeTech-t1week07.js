        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to Week 7 of Creative and Technology Studies! This week we will learn about different tools we use every day and how to use them safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Today we will look at tools we find in the kitchen. I have brought a lunch box/kitchen basket. What do you use to eat your porridge or soup?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Different tools have different names and different jobs. Knowing their names helps us use them correctly and safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Kitchen Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spoon</strong> - Used for scooping and eating soft foods</li>
                <li><strong>Fork</strong> - Used for picking up solid foods</li>
                <li><strong>Plate</strong> - Used for holding our food</li>
                <li><strong>Knife</strong> - Used for cutting food (with adult help!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When we know the names of tools, we can ask for them properly and use them safely!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn how to sort tools into groups based on what we use them for.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Look at the items on our mat: spoon, pencil, broom, crayon, plate. Can we write with a spoon?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Tools have different "jobs." We group tools together when they have the same job.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Tool Groups:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Kitchen Corner</strong> - Tools for eating and preparing food (spoon, fork, plate, knife)</li>
                <li><strong>The School Corner</strong> - Tools for learning and creating (pencil, crayon, book, eraser)</li>
                <li><strong>The Cleaning Corner</strong> - Tools for keeping things tidy (broom, dustpan, cloth)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why do we keep knives away from the "School Corner"?</strong> Knives belong in the kitchen where adults use them safely. Keeping tools in the right place keeps us safe!</p>

                <li><strong>Turning Pages</strong> - Turn gently from the corner, not from the middle.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Crayons</strong> - Press gently and try to stay inside the lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Putting Away</strong> - Close books gently and put tools back in their place.</li>
