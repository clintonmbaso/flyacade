            <p>Welcome to Week 8 of Creative and Technology Studies! This week we will explore different roles through drama and play.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> "What did you see your mother or father doing this morning before you came to school?"</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> We can learn about important jobs at home by pretending to do them ourselves. Today we will focus on cooking and washing.</p>
            <p><strong>Specific Outcome:</strong> Learners will be able to perform roles of cooking and washing through imitation.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Role play helps us understand the work our family members do and prepares us to be helpful at home!</p>
