            <p>Welcome to our nutrition unit! Today we will learn how food acts as fuel for our bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Food is like fuel for our bodies, giving us energy to do everything!</p>
            <p><strong>What are Energy Giving Foods?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Foods that provide carbohydrates and fats</li>
                <li>They give us strength to play, run, and think</li>
                <li>Our body's main source of fuel</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Local Examples:</strong> Nsima, rice, potatoes, bread, cooking oil</p>
            <p><strong>How Energy Works:</strong> Just like a car needs petrol to move, our bodies need energy foods to work properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> What would happen if you tried to run a race without eating breakfast?</p>

            <p>Today is our food classification challenge! Let's show what we've learned.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> We can sort foods into categories based on their main job in our body.</p>
            <p><strong>Review of Categories:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Giving:</strong> Carbohydrates and fats (rice, nsima, oil)</li>
                <li><strong>Body Building:</strong> Proteins (beans, fish, eggs, meat)</li>
                <li><strong>Protective:</strong> Vitamins and minerals (fruits, vegetables)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Some foods can belong to more than one group!</strong> For example, beans have protein (body building) but also some carbohydrates (energy).</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Mission:</strong> Sort mixed foods into the correct categories to show you understand their nutritional value.</p>
            <p><strong>Celebration:</strong> You're now food scientists who understand how different foods help our bodies!</p>
