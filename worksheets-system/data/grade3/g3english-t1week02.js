            <p>Welcome to our English lesson! Today we will learn about the three main seasons and what activities we do in each one.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Seasons are long periods of time where the weather stays mostly the same.</p>
            <p><strong>The Rainy Season:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We need umbrellas, raincoats, and boots</li>
                <li>This is the time for planting seeds</li>
                <li>Plants need water to grow</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Cold Season:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We feel shivery and cold</li>
                <li>We wear sweaters, hats, and scarves</li>
                <li>We stay warm indoors</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Dry Season:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rain has stopped and the sun is hot</li>
                <li>This is often the time for harvesting crops</li>
                <li>We harvest what was planted in the rainy season</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are seasons important?</strong> Seasons help farmers know when to plant and harvest, and help us know what clothes to wear!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to use action verbs and descriptive language to talk about what we do in different seasons.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Verbs are action words that tell us what people do in each season.</p>
            <p><strong>Action Verbs for Seasons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carrying</strong> an umbrella (Rainy Season)</li>
                <li><strong>Wearing</strong> warm clothes (Cold Season)</li>
                <li><strong>Splashing</strong> in puddles (Rainy Season)</li>
                <li><strong>Digging</strong> in the field (Rainy Season)</li>
                <li><strong>Harvesting</strong> crops (Dry Season)</li>
                <li><strong>Building</strong> a fire (Cold Season)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to build a sentence:</strong> Use this frame: "In the [Season], I am [Action] because it is [Weather]."</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "In the Cold Season, I am wearing a jacket because it is chilly."</p>

            <p><strong>What is Drought?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the rainy season is too short or doesn't come at all</li>
                <li>Makes it hard to plant crops</li>
                <li>Makes it hard to find water to drink</li>
                <li>The land becomes very dry and cracked</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is Flooding?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When rain comes all at once and is too heavy</li>
                <li>Can wash away homes and crops</li>
                <li>Too much water at one time</li>
                <li>Can make rivers overflow</li>

            <p><strong>How this affects our activities:</strong> If there's a drought, can we plant? If there's a flood, can we harvest?</p>
            <p><strong>Language Focus:</strong> We use "cause and effect" sentences: "Because of [cause], we have [effect]."</p>
