            <p>Welcome to Week 10 of Grade 3 English! Today we will learn how to listen carefully to an informational text.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> An <em>expository text</em> gives us facts and real information instead of a made-up story.</p>
            <p><strong>Why listen for information?</strong> We listen to learn new things, understand how the world works, and stay healthy!</p>
            <p><strong>Today's focus:</strong> Healthy eating and why vegetables are important for our bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>Listening tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sit quietly and focus on the speaker.</li>
                <li>Think about the main idea.</li>
                <li>Remember important facts.</li>
                <li>Be ready to answer questions after listening.</li>

            <p>Today is <strong>Review Day</strong>! We will put together everything we've learned this week.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Listening, understanding, and speaking about expository texts helps us become better learners and thinkers.</p>
            <p><strong>What we've learned:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expository texts give us facts (Health & Nutrition).</li>
                <li>Rights are things everyone should have (Right to Learn & Play).</li>
                <li>Gender equality means everyone can follow their dreams.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Today's text:</strong> A story that combines health, rights, and fairness—about a girl who speaks up to improve her school's nutrition.</p>
            <p><strong>Oral Assessment:</strong> You will listen, then answer questions out loud to show what you've learned. Let's celebrate your progress!</p>

                Lila learned about healthy eating. She used her right to speak up at a school meeting. She asked for more fruits at lunch. Everyone agreed—boys and girls worked together to make it happen!</p>
