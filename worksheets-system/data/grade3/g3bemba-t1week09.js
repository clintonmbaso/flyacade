            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Start by asking the pupils about a common daily activity, such as fetching water or walking to school. Ask, "Who did this today?" (Nani acita ifi lelo?). Explain that stories often tell us about things we also do in our real lives.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson Body:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read a short story in Bemba about a child who helps their parents at home (e.g., sweeping the yard or washing plates).</li>
                <li>Ask the pupils: "What did the child in the story do?" (Finshi umwana acitile mu lyashi?).</li>
                <li>Ask the pupils to share if they do the same chores at home. Ask, "How is your day the same or different from the child in the story?" (Bushe ubushiku bwenu bupalene shani ne lyashi?).</li>
                <li>Encourage them to use the word "Kupala" (To resemble/be similar) or "Kupusana" (To be different).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarize that listening helps us see how our lives are like the lives of people in stories.</p>
            <p><strong>Expected Standard:</strong> Pupils will compare their own life experiences to the story they heard accordingly.</p>
