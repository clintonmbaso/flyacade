        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our English lesson! Today we will learn about the responsibilities we have in our community.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Just like we have chores at home, we have "chores" for our neighborhood or school to keep them nice for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Vocabulary Focus:</strong> Public property, charity, participation, responsibility, community.</p>
            <p><strong>What is public property?</strong> Things that belong to everyone in the community:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parks and playgrounds</li>
                <li>School buildings and equipment</li>
                <li>Libraries</li>
                <li>Community centers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What does responsibility mean?</strong> Something you should do because it is right and helps others.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is participation important?</strong> When everyone helps, our community becomes better for all!</p>
