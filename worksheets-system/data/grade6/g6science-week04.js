            <p>Welcome to our lesson on making safe and healthy choices for our bodies. Today we'll discuss what it means to make responsible decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Early sexual debut means engaging in sexual activity at a young age, which can lead to various health risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Health Risks Associated with Early Sexual Activity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
                <li>Unplanned teenage pregnancy</li>
                <li>Emotional and psychological stress</li>
                <li>Interruption of education and future plans</li>
                <li>Potential impact on physical development</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Making Safe and Healthy Choices:</strong> It's important to wait until you're older, in a committed relationship, and fully informed about the responsibilities and consequences. Always talk to trusted adults about these important decisions.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the wonderful world of vitamins and minerals! These essential nutrients help our bodies grow, stay strong, and fight off illnesses.</p>

                <li><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach (good for eyesight)</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Oranges, strawberries, bell peppers (helps heal wounds and fight infections)</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Sunlight, fortified milk, eggs (strengthens bones)</li>
