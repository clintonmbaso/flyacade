            <p>Welcome to our exploration of blood! Today we will learn about the different components that make up our blood and what each part does to keep us healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Blood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to cells and transports waste products away. It is composed of several important components.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Components of Blood:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plasma:</strong> The liquid part of blood (about 55%) that carries nutrients, hormones, and proteins</li>
                <li><strong>Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):</strong> Carry oxygen from lungs to body tissues</li>
                <li><strong>White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):</strong> Fight infections and diseases</li>
                <li><strong>Platelets (Thrombocytes):</strong> Help blood clot to prevent excessive bleeding</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is understanding blood composition important?</strong> Each component has a specific job that helps maintain our health. If one part isn't working properly, it can affect our entire body!</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the amazing functions of blood! Blood does much more than just flow through our bodies - it performs several critical jobs that keep us alive and healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>The Four Main Functions of Blood:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Carries oxygen from lungs to cells, nutrients from digestive system to cells, hormones from glands to target organs, and waste products to organs for removal</li>
                <li><strong>Defense:</strong> White blood cells fight bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens; antibodies in plasma provide immunity</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Helps regulate body temperature, pH balance, and water content in cells</li>
                <li><strong>Clotting:</strong> Platelets and clotting factors stop bleeding when we're injured</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Transportation Details:</strong> Blood acts like a delivery service. Red blood cells deliver oxygen, plasma carries dissolved nutrients, and both work together to remove waste like carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> When germs invade, white blood cells quickly respond. Some surround and eat bacteria, while others make antibodies that remember specific germs for future protection.</p>
