            <p>Welcome to our lesson on leftover foods! Today we will learn what leftovers are, why they are important, and how to handle them safely.</p>
            <p><strong>What are Leftover Foods?</strong> Leftovers are cooked foods that remain uneaten after a meal. They can be stored and eaten later.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Examples of Leftovers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooked rice or pasta</li>
                <li>Stews, soups, or curries</li>
                <li>Roasted or grilled meats</li>
                <li>Vegetable dishes</li>
                <li>Baked goods like bread or cakes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Use Leftovers?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost-saving:</strong> Reduces food expenses by making the most of what you buy</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing food waste:</strong> Helps protect the environment by throwing away less food</li>
                <li><strong>Saving time:</strong> Preparing meals from leftovers is quicker than cooking from scratch</li>
                <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Ready-to-eat meals for busy days</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Golden Rules for Handling Leftovers:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cool Quickly:</strong> Allow hot food to cool to room temperature within 2 hours before storing</li>
                <li><strong>Store in Airtight Containers:</strong> Use containers with tight-fitting lids to keep food fresh and prevent contamination</li>
                <li><strong>Refrigerate Promptly:</strong> Store leftovers in the refrigerator within 2 hours of cooking</li>
                <li><strong>Use Within 2–3 Days:</strong> Most leftovers should be eaten within 2–3 days for best quality and safety</li>
                <li><strong>Label and Date:</strong> Write what's inside and when it was stored to track freshness</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Proper leftover management saves money, reduces waste, and keeps your family safe from foodborne illnesses.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to handle and reheat leftovers safely to prevent foodborne illnesses. Food safety is everyone's responsibility!</p>
            <p><strong>The Danger Zone:</strong> Bacteria grow fastest between 5°C and 60°C (41°F and 140°F). This temperature range is called the "Danger Zone."</p>
            <p><strong>Key Food Safety Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep Hot Foods Hot:</strong> Above 60°C (140°F)</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Cold Foods Cold:</strong> Below 5°C (41°F)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize Time in Danger Zone:</strong> Don't leave food at room temperature for more than 2 hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reheating Leftovers Safely:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reheat Until Piping Hot:</strong> Leftovers must reach at least 75°C (167°F) all the way through</li>
                <li><strong>Stir Food While Reheating:</strong> This ensures even heating throughout</li>
                <li><strong>Check Temperature:</strong> Use a food thermometer if possible, or make sure steam is coming from all parts of the food</li>
                <li><strong>Never Reheat More Than Once:</strong> Reheat only the amount you plan to eat immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Use Proper Methods:</strong> Stovetop, microwave, or oven reheating are all acceptable if done properly</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Checking for Spoiled Food:</strong> Use your senses to identify food that should not be eaten:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Sour, rotten, or unusual odors</li>
                <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Slimy, sticky, or mushy surfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Mold, discoloration, or unusual spots</li>
                <li><strong>When in Doubt, Throw It Out!</strong> It's better to waste a small amount of food than risk getting sick</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Storage Safety Measures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store leftovers in shallow containers to cool faster</li>
                <li>Keep refrigerator temperature at or below 4°C (40°F)</li>
                <li>Don't overcrowd the refrigerator—air needs to circulate</li>
                <li>Place newer leftovers behind older ones to use first (First In, First Out)</li>
