            <p>Welcome to Week 9! This week, we will become masters of conjunctions—the glue that holds our sentences together.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will identify and use conjunctions that show reasons or results.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Conjunctions connect ideas. Today, we focus on cause and effect: one event happens BECAUSE OF another.</p>
            <p><strong>Target Conjunctions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Because of:</strong> "The picnic was cancelled because of the rain." (Shows reason)</li>
                <li><strong>Since:</strong> "Since you finished your homework, you can watch TV." (Shows reason/cause)</li>
                <li><strong>Therefore:</strong> "He forgot his lines; therefore, the play was delayed." (Shows result/effect)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Grammar Tip:</strong> "Because of" is followed by a noun phrase. "Since" is followed by a subject + verb. "Therefore" usually connects two independent clauses with a semicolon.</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Cause and effect conjunctions help us explain why things happen and justify our arguments in writing!</p>

            <p>Today we will focus on conjunctions that highlight the <strong>outcome</strong> of an action.</p>
