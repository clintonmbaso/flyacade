            <p>Welcome to our exploration of modern technology tools. Today we will learn about cloud computing and how it changes the way we work and collaborate.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> "The Cloud" refers to online services that store and process data on remote servers instead of your personal computer.</p>
            <p><strong>Local vs. Cloud Storage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>USB Drive/Computer:</strong> Files stored on physical devices you carry with you</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Files stored online (Google Docs, Microsoft 365, OnlyOffice)</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages of Cloud:</strong> Access from anywhere, automatic backup, easy sharing</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Real-Time Synchronization:</strong> When multiple people work on the same cloud document, changes appear instantly for everyone. This allows for true collaboration.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Cloud Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)</li>
                <li>Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint Online)</li>
                <li>OnlyOffice</li>
                <li>Dropbox Paper</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Cloud tools prepare us for modern workplaces and make group projects much easier!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn how to share documents safely and understand different access levels. Sharing responsibly is an important digital skill.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> When you share a cloud document, you control what others can do with it through permissions.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Main Access Levels:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Can only read the document. Cannot make changes or comments.</li>
                <li><strong>Commenter:</strong> Can read and add comments or suggestions. Cannot directly edit the text.</li>
                <li><strong>Editor:</strong> Can read, comment, and make changes to the document. Has full editing rights.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>How to Share Safely:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always share with specific people using their email addresses</li>
                <li>Choose the appropriate access level for each person</li>
                <li>Never use "Anyone with the link" for school documents</li>
                <li>Review your sharing settings regularly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> "Anyone with the link" means anyone on the internet could find and access your document. Only use this for public information that doesn't contain personal details.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Permissions Matter:</strong> They protect your work, respect others' contributions, and maintain digital security.</p>

            <p>Today we will practice the most exciting feature of cloud tools: real-time collaboration. Multiple people can work on the same document simultaneously!</p>
            <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Respect other people's cursors. Never type where someone else is currently working.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features of Collaborative Editing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Presence Icons:</strong> Colored circles or cursors showing who is currently in the document</li>
                <li><strong>Live Cursors:</strong> You can see exactly where others are typing in real-time</li>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Editing:</strong> Multiple people can type at the same time without conflicts</li>
                <li><strong>Chat/Suggesting Mode:</strong> Built-in communication tools within the document</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Collaboration Etiquette:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Announce yourself when joining a shared document</li>
