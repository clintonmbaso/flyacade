            <p>Welcome to our exploration of one of nature's most amazing processes! Today we'll discover how plants make their own food.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p><strong>What Plants Need for Photosynthesis:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Provides the energy needed for the process</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Absorbed from the soil through roots</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide:</strong> Taken in from the air through tiny openings called stomata</li>
                <li><strong>Chlorophyll:</strong> The green pigment in leaves that captures sunlight</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Photosynthesis Equation:</strong></p>
            <p>Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose (food) + Oxygen</p>
            <p><strong>Why Photosynthesis Matters:</strong> This process not only feeds plants but also produces the oxygen we breathe and removes carbon dioxide from the air.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we'll conduct an exciting experiment to prove that plants produce food through photosynthesis!</p>
            <p><strong>Why Test for Starch?</strong> Glucose produced during photosynthesis is converted into starch for storage. Finding starch in leaves proves photosynthesis has occurred.</p>
            <p><strong>The Iodine Test:</strong> Iodine solution turns blue-black in the presence of starch.</p>
            <p><strong>Experiment Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boil the leaf:</strong> To break down cell walls and make it easier for iodine to penetrate</li>
                <li><strong>Heat in ethanol:</strong> To remove chlorophyll (the green pigment) so we can see the color change</li>
                <li><strong>Wash and add iodine:</strong> To test for starch presence</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> If photosynthesis occurred, the leaf will turn blue-black. If not, it will remain brownish-yellow.</p>
            <p><strong>Safety First!</strong> We'll use hot water baths and alcohol under teacher supervision only.</p>
