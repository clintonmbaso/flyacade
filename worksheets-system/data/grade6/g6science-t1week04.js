            <p>Welcome to our study of over-nutrition! Today we will explore how eating too much of certain nutrients can harm our health.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Over-nutrition occurs when we consume too much of specific nutrients, leading to serious health problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Major Health Risks:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excessive body fat accumulation caused by consuming too many calories, especially from fats and sugars</li>
                <li><strong>Hypertension:</strong> High blood pressure often linked to excessive salt intake</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Disease:</strong> Poor diet choices can lead to blocked arteries and reduced blood flow to the heart</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Does This Happen?</strong> When we regularly eat more nutrients than our body needs, especially unhealthy fats, sugars, and salt, it can damage our organs and systems over time.</p>

                <p>Eating fast food daily can lead to consuming twice the recommended daily salt intake. This extra salt causes the body to retain water, increasing blood pressure and straining the heart.</p>

            <p><strong>Three Prevention Strategies:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Balanced Diets:</strong> Following the Food Pyramid/Plate guidelines ensures we get all necessary nutrients in proper proportions</li>

                <li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Regular exercise helps burn excess calories and strengthens the heart and bones</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The Healthy Plate Model:</strong> A balanced meal should include:
                <ul>
                    <li>50% Fruits and Vegetables</li>
