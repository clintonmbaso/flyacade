        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our first lesson on safety tools. Today we will explore the essential items found in a First Aid kit and learn how each one helps in an emergency.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> First Aid is the immediate help given to an injured person before professional medical help arrives. A well-stocked First Aid kit is our safety toolbox.</p>
            <p><strong>Common First Aid Kit Items:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adhesive Plasters (Band-Aids):</strong> Cover small cuts and scrapes to keep them clean</li>
                <li><strong>Sterile Gauze:</strong> Used for larger wounds to absorb blood and protect the injury</li>
                <li><strong>Antiseptic Wipes:</strong> Clean wounds to prevent infection</li>
                <li><strong>Scissors:</strong> Cut tape, gauze, or clothing if needed</li>
                <li><strong>Tweezers:</strong> Remove splinters or debris from wounds</li>
                <li><strong>Disposable Gloves:</strong> Protect both the helper and injured person from germs</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Tape:</strong> Secure dressings in place</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Pins:</strong> Fasten bandages or slings</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Kit Maintenance:</strong> A good First Aid kit should be kept clean, organized, and checked regularly to replace used or expired items.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will apply creative thinking to design and build our own First Aid carriers from recycled materials.</p>
            <p><strong>Where to Keep First Aid Kits:</strong> First Aid kits should be kept in easy-to-reach places like homes, schools, and cars. They need to be portable and easy to find during emergencies.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Considerations:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Bright colors or red crosses make kits easy to spot</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Materials should protect contents from damage</li>
                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Items should be arranged so they're easy to find quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Handles or straps make kits easy to carry</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Liquids should be stored upright to prevent leaks</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Common Materials:</strong> Shoe boxes, plastic containers, sturdy fabric, cardboard, and recycled packaging can all be transformed into effective First Aid carriers.</p>
            <p><strong>The Red Cross Symbol:</strong> This universal symbol helps people immediately identify First Aid supplies. Always include it on your carrier.</p>

            <p>Today we will practice the correct steps to take when someone is injured, using role-play and guided practice.</p>
            <p><strong>The DRS Rule:</strong> Always follow these steps first:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Danger:</strong> Check that the area is safe for you and the injured person</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> Gently ask "Are you okay?" or tap their shoulder</li>
                <li><strong>Send for Help:</strong> Call an adult or emergency services if needed</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Basic Wound Care Steps:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Wash your hands or wear disposable gloves</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clean the wound with antiseptic wipe (wipe away from the cut)</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Apply appropriate dressing (plaster for small cuts, gauze for larger wounds)</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Secure dressing with tape if needed</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Comfort the person and explain what you're doing</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Expected Standard:</strong> Applying First Aid correctly is vital for proper healing and preventing infection. Always stay calm and follow the steps in order.</p>
            <p><strong>When to Get Help:</strong> If bleeding doesn't stop, the wound is deep, or the person seems very unwell, get an adult immediately.</p>
