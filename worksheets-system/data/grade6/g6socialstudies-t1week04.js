            <p>Welcome to our study of government structure! Today we will explore how governments are organized to serve the people and maintain order.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Most democratic governments are divided into three branches to prevent any one part from having too much power.</p>
            <p><strong>The Three Branches of Government:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legislature:</strong> Makes the laws</li>
                <li><strong>Executive:</strong> Implements and enforces the laws</li>
                <li><strong>Judiciary:</strong> Interprets the laws and settles disputes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Three Branches?</strong> This separation of powers creates a system of checks and balances where each branch can limit the power of the others, ensuring accountability and preventing abuse of power.</p>
            <p><strong>Interdependence:</strong> While each branch has distinct functions, they must work together for government to function effectively. Like three legs of a stool, each supports the others.</p>

                <p>Think of government like a school: The principal (Executive) enforces rules, teachers and student council (Legislature) help make rules, and guidance counselors (Judiciary) help resolve conflicts about rules.</p>

                <p>The concept of three branches of government was first clearly described by French philosopher Montesquieu in the 1700s and was adopted by many democracies including the United States.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Checks and Balances</div>
                <p>For example: The legislature makes laws, but the executive can veto them. The judiciary can declare laws unconstitutional. This keeps power balanced!</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the Legislature in detail - the branch of government responsible for making laws and representing the people.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Functions of the Legislature:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lawmaking:</strong> Creates, debates, and passes laws that govern society</li>
                <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Legislators represent the interests of their constituents (the people in their area)</li>
                <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Monitors the Executive branch to ensure laws are properly implemented</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Approval:</strong> Controls government spending by approving budgets and allocating resources</li>
                <li><strong>Public Forum:</strong> Provides a platform for discussing national issues and concerns</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>How Laws Are Made:</strong> Laws usually start as proposals called bills. They go through committees, debates, and votes in both houses of legislature before becoming law.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance to Society:</strong> Laws created by the legislature protect rights, maintain order, provide services, and address social needs. Without laws, society would be chaotic!</p>

            <p>Today we will study the Executive branch - the part of government responsible for implementing laws and managing day-to-day governance.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Functions of the Executive:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Implementing Laws:</strong> Puts laws passed by the legislature into action</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Formulation:</strong> Develops detailed plans and regulations to achieve law's objectives</li>
                <li><strong>Managing Public Services:</strong> Oversees departments like education, health, transportation, and defense</li>
                <li><strong>International Representation:</strong> Represents the country in foreign affairs and diplomacy</li>
                <li><strong>Commanding Armed Forces:</strong> Serves as commander-in-chief of military forces</li>
                <li><strong>Appointing Officials:</strong> Selects people to run government departments and agencies</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>From Law to Action:</strong> When the legislature passes a law (like education reform), the executive creates the specific policies, hires teachers, builds schools, and allocates funds to make it happen.</p>
            <p><strong>Daily Governance:</strong> While the legislature makes the rules, the executive makes sure those rules are followed and services are delivered to citizens every day.</p>
