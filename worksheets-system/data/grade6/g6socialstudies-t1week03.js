            <p>Welcome to our study of social inequalities. Today we will explore how discrimination affects women and girls in different areas of life.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Gender discrimination refers to unfair treatment based on a person's sex or gender. This affects women and girls in education, work, and daily life.</p>
            <p><strong>Education Inequality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In some communities, girls receive less education than boys</li>
                <li>Girls may be expected to help at home instead of attending school</li>
                <li>Schools may lack separate bathrooms for girls, causing them to drop out</li>
                <li>Fewer female teachers and role models in some areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Workplace Discrimination:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Women often earn less than men for the same work (gender pay gap)</li>
                <li>Fewer women in leadership positions (glass ceiling)</li>
                <li>Women may face harassment or unfair treatment at work</li>
                <li>Some jobs are considered "men's work" and women are discouraged from pursuing them</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> When women and girls face discrimination, they cannot reach their full potential. This hurts not only them but their families and communities too.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about child abuse - what it is, its different forms, and how it affects children. Every child deserves to feel safe and protected.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Child Abuse?</strong> Child abuse is when someone harms a child, either through action or by failing to act. It can be physical, emotional, or sexual.</p>
            <p><strong>Four Main Types of Child Abuse:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Physical Abuse:</strong> Causing physical harm to a child (hitting, burning, shaking)</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Abuse:</strong> Harming a child's self-esteem or emotional well-being (constant criticism, threats, rejection)</li>
                <li><strong>Sexual Abuse:</strong> Involving a child in sexual activities they don't understand or can't consent to</li>
                <li><strong>Neglect:</strong> Failing to provide for a child's basic needs (food, shelter, medical care, supervision)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Effects of Abuse:</strong> Abuse can cause physical injuries, emotional problems, difficulty in school, and trouble forming healthy relationships later in life.</p>
            <p><strong>Protecting Children:</strong> All children have the right to be safe. If you or someone you know is being abused, tell a trusted adult like a teacher, parent, or counselor.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn about child labour - when children are forced to work instead of going to school and playing. Every child deserves an education and a childhood.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Child Labour?</strong> Child labour is work that is harmful to children's physical, mental, or social development. It deprives them of their childhood and education.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Child Labour:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hazardous Work:</strong> Working in mines, with chemicals, or dangerous machinery</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic Work:</strong> Working long hours as house servants, often hidden from view</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Work:</strong> Working on farms, often with pesticides and heavy lifting</li>
                <li><strong>Factory Work:</strong> Working in manufacturing, often in poor conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Street Work:</strong> Selling items, begging, or shining shoes on streets</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Children Work:</strong> Poverty is the main cause. Families may need children's income to survive. Sometimes children are tricked or forced into work.</p>
            <p><strong>Effects of Child Labour:</strong> Children miss education, face health risks, work in dangerous conditions, and don't have time to play or rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Supporting education, enforcing laws against child labour, and helping families overcome poverty can reduce child labour.</p>
