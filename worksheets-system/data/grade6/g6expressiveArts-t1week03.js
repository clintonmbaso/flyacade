        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our exploration of movement mastery. Today we will focus on how our senses and body work together for coordinated movement.</p>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Perceptual motor learning skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to demonstrate perceptual motor learning skills through coordination games.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Our eyes, ears, and bodies must work together to move accurately and respond to our environment. Perceptual motor skills involve processing sensory information (what we see and hear) and turning it into physical movement.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> The ability to use different parts of the body together smoothly and efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction Time:</strong> How quickly we respond to a stimulus</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial Awareness:</strong> Understanding where your body is in space and in relation to others</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptual Motor Skills:</strong> Connecting what we perceive (see/hear) with how we move</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> These skills are essential for sports, dance, daily activities, and even classroom learning. They help us move safely and effectively.</p>

                <p>A goalkeeper in football uses perceptual motor skills to see where the ball is coming from and react quickly to save it. Their eyes, brain, and body must coordinate instantly.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we continue our movement mastery by focusing on agility and deceptive movements. These skills are essential in sports, dance, and many physical activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Dribbling and feinting skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to demonstrate perceptual motor skills through dribbling and feinting.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> "Feinting" means making a deceptive move to mislead an opponent. Combined with dribbling (controlling a ball while moving), these skills require excellent perceptual motor control, balance, and spatial awareness.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agility:</strong> The ability to move quickly and easily, changing direction with control</li>
                <li><strong>Dribbling:</strong> Controlling a ball while moving, using either hands or feet</li>
                <li><strong>Feinting:</strong> A deceptive movement meant to trick an opponent about your intended direction</li>
                <li><strong>Body Control:</strong> Maintaining balance and coordination while performing complex movements</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> These skills develop physical fitness, strategic thinking, and confidence in movement. They're used in basketball, football, hockey, martial arts, and dance.</p>

                <p>In basketball, players use dribbling to move while controlling the ball and feints (like a crossover dribble) to get past defenders. This requires hand-eye coordination and agility.</p>
