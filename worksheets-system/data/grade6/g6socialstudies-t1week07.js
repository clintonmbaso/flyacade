            <p>Welcome to our study of the Constitution! Today we will explore the foundation of our nation's laws and government.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The Constitution is the supreme law of the land that establishes how our government works and protects our rights.</p>
            <p><strong>What is the Constitution?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A written document that outlines the framework of government</li>
                <li>The highest law in the country—all other laws must follow it</li>
                <li>A living document that can be amended when needed</li>
                <li>A protector of citizens' rights and freedoms</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is the Constitution important?</strong> Without the Constitution, there would be no clear rules for how our government should operate or how our rights should be protected. It creates stability and fairness for all citizens.</p>
            <p><strong>The Preamble:</strong> The introduction to the Constitution that begins with "We the People" and states the purposes of our government.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will explore one of the most important ideas in the Constitution: the separation of powers. This system prevents any one part of government from becoming too powerful.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Separation of Powers?</strong> The division of government responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another.</p>
            <p><strong>The Three Branches of Government:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Legislative Branch (Congress):</strong> Makes the laws. Includes the Senate and House of Representatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Executive Branch (President):</strong> Enforces the laws. Includes the President, Vice President, and Cabinet.</li>
                <li><strong>Judicial Branch (Courts):</strong> Interprets the laws. Includes the Supreme Court and other federal courts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> Each branch has some control over the others, creating a system of checks and balances. For example, the President can veto laws from Congress, but Congress can override the veto with enough votes.</p>
            <p><strong>Why This System Matters:</strong> This system prevents tyranny, protects our freedoms, and ensures that government serves the people.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Legislative Example</div>
                <p>When Congress passes a bill (a proposed law), it must go to the President to be signed. If the President vetoes it, Congress can try to override the veto with a 2/3 vote in both houses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Judicial Example</div>
                <p>The Supreme Court can declare a law unconstitutional if it violates the Constitution. This is called judicial review and is a key check on the other branches.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the responsibilities that come with being a citizen.</p>
            <p><strong>What are Constitutional Rights?</strong> These are freedoms and protections specifically guaranteed by the Constitution and its amendments (especially the Bill of Rights—the first 10 amendments).</p>
            <p><strong>Key Rights Protected:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> The right to express your opinions</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Religion:</strong> The right to practice any religion or none at all</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Assembly:</strong> The right to gather peacefully</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Petition:</strong> The right to ask the government to address grievances</li>
                <li><strong>Due Process:</strong> Fair treatment through the judicial system</li>
                <li><strong>Equal Protection:</strong> The right to equal treatment under the law</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Citizen Responsibilities:</strong> Along with rights come responsibilities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Obeying laws</li>
                <li>Paying taxes</li>
                <li>Participating in the democratic process (voting)</li>
                <li>Staying informed about current issues</li>
                <li>Respecting the rights of others</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Both Matter:</strong> Rights protect our freedoms, while responsibilities help maintain a fair and orderly society.</p>
