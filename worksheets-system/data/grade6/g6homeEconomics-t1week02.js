            <p>Welcome to our exploration of how our bodies process food. Today we will follow the amazing journey of food from your mouth through your digestive system.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Digestion is the process by which your body breaks down food into nutrients it can use for energy, growth, and repair.</p>
            <p><strong>The Digestive Journey:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> Where mechanical breakdown starts with teeth and enzymes begin working on food</li>
                <li><strong>Stomach:</strong> Acts as a "mixing bowl" using acid to further break down food</li>
                <li><strong>Small Intestine:</strong> Where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream</li>
                <li><strong>Large Intestine:</strong> Where water is absorbed and waste is prepared for exit</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Common Digestive Problems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bloating:</strong> Feeling "too full" or gassy after eating</li>
                <li><strong>Constipation:</strong> Difficulty passing waste, often due to lack of water or fiber</li>
                <li><strong>Heartburn:</strong> A burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Understanding digestion helps us make better food choices and recognize when our digestive system needs attention.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how different foods affect our digestion and energy levels. We'll discover how to choose foods that fuel our bodies properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The foods we eat can either support our digestive health or cause problems. Making wise choices helps us feel energized and healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>The "Helpful" Foods (Support Digestion):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-fiber foods:</strong> Fruit salads, mixed vegetable salads, whole grains</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Plenty of water throughout the day</li>
                <li><strong>Probiotic foods:</strong> Yogurt, fermented foods that support gut health</li>
                <li><strong>Lean proteins:</strong> Chicken, fish, beans, lentils</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The "Not Helpful" Foods (Can Disrupt Digestion):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly processed foods:</strong> Heavy in preservatives, additives, and unhealthy fats</li>
                <li><strong>Carbonated drinks:</strong> Introduce excess gas and sugar</li>
                <li><strong>Fried foods:</strong> Can cause heartburn and sluggish digestion</li>
                <li><strong>Excess sugar:</strong> Can lead to energy crashes and digestive issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Meal Planning Principle:</strong> Variety is key! Eating different types of foods ensures we get all necessary nutrients for optimal health.</p>
