    lessonContent: `
        <p>Welcome to Week 8! This week, we are exploring how prepositions help us measure and describe ownership. Today, we focus on measure.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will identify and use prepositions of measure like "by" and "per" in context.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Prepositions don’t just show location—they also show measurement, limits, and rates.</p>
        <p><strong>'By' for Time (Deadlines and Limits):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I will finish my homework by 5:00 PM."</li>
            <li>"The package should arrive by Friday."</li>
            <li>"She learned the song by heart." (idiom)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>'Per' for Rate and Quantity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The cost is K50 per person."</li>
            <li>"He can run 5 kilometres per hour."</li>
            <li>"We have English lessons three times per week."</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Using precise prepositions helps us communicate clearly about time, money, and schedules—essential skills for real-life conversations!</p>

    subject: "English",
    topic: "Prepositions of Possession",
    subtopic: "Using 'of' to show belonging and relationships",
    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we will learn how the preposition 'of' can show possession and relationships between things and people.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will use "of" to demonstrate ownership and connection.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> While the apostrophe s ('s) is common for possession, 'of' is often used for things, places, or formal relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>Structures with 'Of':</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The leg of the table" (part of an object)</li>
            <li>"The capital of Zambia" (belonging to a place)</li>
            <li>"A friend of mine" / "A sister of his" (belonging to a person)</li>
            <li>"The title of the book" (attribute of an object)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Comparing 's and 'Of':</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The dog's tail → The tail of the dog</li>
            <li>My mother's name → The name of my mother</li>
            <li>The team's victory → The victory of the team</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Using 'of' correctly makes your writing more formal and varied.</p>

        <p>Congratulations on completing Week 8! Today we will demonstrate everything we have learned about prepositions of measure and possession.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To demonstrate mastery of prepositions in measure and possession through a comprehensive writing task.</p>
        <p><strong>Final Review:</strong> Prepositions change the meaning of a sentence. Compare:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I will finish by Friday." (deadline) vs. "I will finish on Friday." (specific day)</li>
            <li>"A friend of mine." (relationship) vs. "A friend with mine." (incorrect)</li>
            <li>"The car with the sunroof." (feature) vs. "The car belongs to her." (ownership)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Expected Standard (Syllabus):</strong> By the end of this week, students should be able to use prepositions (by, per, of, with, to) accurately in various contexts, including formal and informal writing.</p>

            <p>Dear Chanda,</p>
            <p>I hope you are well. I want to tell you about my new pet! I have a puppy with soft brown fur and floppy ears. He is a friend of ours now. I feed him twice per day, and I must walk him by 6:00 PM every evening. The leash belongs to my older brother, but he said I can use it. The name of my puppy is Coffee. I love the sound of his happy bark!</p>
