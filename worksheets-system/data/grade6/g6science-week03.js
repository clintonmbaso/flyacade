        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our study of human pregnancy! Today we will explore what pregnancy is and how it begins.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Pregnancy is the period when a baby develops inside a woman's uterus (womb). It begins when a sperm from a male fertilizes an egg from a female.</p>
            <p><strong>How Pregnancy Occurs:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fertilization: When sperm meets egg</li>
                <li>Implantation: The fertilized egg attaches to the uterus wall</li>
                <li>Development: The embryo grows into a fetus</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Female Reproductive System:</strong> Understanding the basic parts helps us understand pregnancy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ovaries: Produce eggs</li>
                <li>Fallopian tubes: Where fertilization usually occurs</li>
                <li>Uterus (womb): Where the baby develops</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is understanding pregnancy important?</strong> Pregnancy is a natural process that creates new human life. Understanding it helps us appreciate human development and health.</p>

                <p>Think of the uterus like a protective, nurturing home that grows with the baby. Just as a house provides shelter and space, the uterus provides protection and nutrients for the developing baby.</p>
