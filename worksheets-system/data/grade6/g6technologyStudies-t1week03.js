            <p>Welcome to our exploration of building tools. Today we will learn why specific tools are essential for construction and identify some basic building tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> A "Building Tool" is a specialized instrument designed to help us construct things safely, accurately, and efficiently. We can't build properly with just our bare hands.</p>
            <p><strong>Why We Need Special Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tools help us work with precision and accuracy</li>
                <li>They make construction safer than using our hands</li>
                <li>Specialized tools are designed for specific building tasks</li>
                <li>They help us create stronger, more durable structures</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Today's Building Tools:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Spirit Level:</strong> A long, flat tool with liquid in a tube to check if surfaces are perfectly horizontal or vertical</li>
                <li><strong>Building Square:</strong> A tool with a fixed 90-degree angle used to check and create perfect corners</li>
                <li><strong>Trowel:</strong> A flat metal tool with a handle used for spreading and shaping mortar or plaster</li>
                <li><strong>Wooden Float:</strong> A flat wooden tool used to smooth and finish surfaces</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Always handle tools carefully. Keep sharp edges away from yourself and others.</p>

                <p>The spirit level is long and flat so it can measure across surfaces. The liquid bubble shows when something is perfectly level. Without it, walls might lean or floors might slope.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-drafting-compass"></i> Building Square Example</div>
                <p>The building square always has a perfect 90-degree angle. Builders use it to make sure corners are square, which is essential for strong, stable structures.</p>

        topic: "The Right Tool for the Job (Classification)",
        subtopic: "Classifying tools by their specific uses in building stages",
        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn how builders organize tools based on when and how they're used in the construction process.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Tools are grouped by the "stage" of building they're used for. Using the right tool at the right time makes building more efficient and results better.</p>
            <p><strong>Three Main Tool Categories:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Laying Tools:</strong> Used for picking up mortar and placing bricks or blocks
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: <strong>Trowel</strong> - spreads and shapes mortar between bricks</li>
                        <li>Purpose: Creates strong bonds between building materials</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wall Straightening Tools:</strong> Used to ensure walls are vertical and corners are square
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples: <strong>Spirit Level</strong> - checks horizontal and vertical alignment</li>
                        <li>Example: <strong>Building Square</strong> - ensures perfect 90-degree corners</li>
                        <li>Purpose: Makes structures stable, straight, and safe</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Finishing Tools:</strong> Used to smooth out surfaces at the end of construction
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: <strong>Wooden Float</strong> - creates smooth, even surfaces on plaster or concrete</li>
                        <li>Purpose: Gives structures a clean, finished appearance</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Classification Matters:</strong> Builders need to quickly find the right tool for each task. Misusing tools can damage them or create poor results.</p>

                <p>The trowel is perfectly shaped for scooping mortar from a board and spreading it between bricks. Its pointed tip helps clean excess mortar from joints.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v"></i> Straightening Tools Example</div>
                <p>Using a spirit level, a builder can check if a wall is perfectly vertical (plumb). Even a small lean can make a wall unstable over time.</p>

            <p>Today we will apply what we've learned by using building tools to construct a small-scale model structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Safety Rules First:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always handle tools with care</li>
                <li>Keep your work area clean and organized</li>
                <li>Use tools only for their intended purposes</li>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Gather your materials - miniature bricks/blocks and "mortar" (wet sand or clay)</li>
                <li><strong>Laying Stage:</strong> Use the trowel to spread mortar and place bricks</li>
                <li><strong>Straightening Stage:</strong> Use the spirit level to check vertical alignment and building square for corners</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing Stage:</strong> Use the wooden float to smooth surfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Check your work against the "Expected Standard"</li>

                <li>Check each brick with the spirit level as you build</li>

                <li>Finish with light, even pressure using the wooden float</li>
