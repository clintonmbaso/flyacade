            <p>Welcome to our study of livestock management! Today we will explore why farmers often keep animals together in groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Keeping livestock together in appropriate groups provides multiple benefits for both the animals and farmers.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Advantages of Grouping Livestock:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Animals in groups can protect each other from predators</li>
                <li><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Many animals are social creatures that thrive in groups</li>
                <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Grouping makes breeding more natural and successful</li>
                <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Sick animals are easier to identify in groups</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Resource Use:</strong> Feeding and watering animals together saves time and resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is grouping important?</strong> Proper grouping mimics natural animal behavior and promotes better health, growth, and productivity. Animals that live in appropriate social groups are generally happier and healthier!</p>

            <p>Today we will explore what happens when too many animals are kept in too little space. While grouping has benefits, overcrowding creates serious problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Overcrowding livestock leads to health issues, behavioral problems, and environmental damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Disadvantages of Overcrowding:</strong></p>

                <li><strong>Poor Air Quality:</strong> Ammonia from waste builds up, causing respiratory issues</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Competition:</strong> Animals compete for food, water, and space</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> Manure buildup can contaminate soil and water</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Growth:</strong> Stressed animals don't grow or produce as well</li>
            </ol>
