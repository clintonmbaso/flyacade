        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our lesson on interpreting children's clinic cards! Today we will learn how to read and understand important health information recorded by doctors and nurses.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> A children's clinic card is an important health record that tracks a child's growth, vaccinations, and dietary habits over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Sections of a Clinic Card:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal information (name, age, birth date)</li>
                <li>Growth charts (height and weight measurements)</li>
                <li>Vaccination records</li>
                <li>Dietary intake and nutrition notes</li>
                <li>Medical history and checkup dates</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are clinic cards important?</strong> They help healthcare workers monitor a child's development, identify potential health problems early, and provide appropriate dietary advice based on recorded information.</p>
