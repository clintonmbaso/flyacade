        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our exploration of food processing! Today we will learn how foods are transformed from their natural state into what we find in stores and kitchens.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Food processing refers to any method used to turn fresh foods into food products. This can range from simple washing to complex manufacturing.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Process Food?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To make food safe to eat (killing bacteria)</li>
                <li>To preserve food for longer storage</li>
                <li>To make food more convenient to prepare</li>
                <li>To create new food products</li>
                <li>To improve taste and texture</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Levels of Food Processing:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Minimally Processed:</strong> Foods that are washed, trimmed, or packaged but otherwise unchanged (like bagged salads, fresh fruits)</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Processed:</strong> Foods altered for preservation (like canned vegetables, frozen fruits, pasteurized milk)</li>
                <li><strong>Moderately Processed:</strong> Foods with added ingredients (like bread, cheese, yogurt)</li>
                <li><strong>Highly Processed:</strong> Ready-to-eat foods with many additives (like chips, cookies, instant noodles)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Physical Processing Techniques:</strong> These are mechanical ways we change food's form:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crushing:</strong> Breaking food into smaller pieces by pressure</li>
                <li><strong>Chopping:</strong> Cutting food into pieces with a knife</li>
                <li><strong>Grinding:</strong> Reducing food to fine particles</li>
                <li><strong>Pressing:</strong> Applying force to extract liquids</li>
                <li><strong>Flaking:</strong> Creating thin, flat pieces</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>From Harvest to Table:</strong> Most foods go through some processing before reaching our homes. Even "fresh" foods like apples are often washed, sorted, and packaged.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will explore how modern tools and appliances make food preparation easier, faster, and less physically demanding.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Labour-saving devices are tools, appliances, or machines that reduce the time, effort, or skill needed to complete kitchen tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Use Labour-Saving Devices?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save time (complete tasks faster)</li>
                <li>Reduce physical effort (less tiring)</li>
                <li>Increase consistency (more reliable results)</li>
                <li>Allow multitasking (work on several things at once)</li>
                <li>Make difficult tasks possible for more people</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common Kitchen Appliances and Their Functions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Blender:</strong> Used for liquefying, pureeing, or mixing liquids and soft foods. Perfect for smoothies, soups, and sauces.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Mixer:</strong> Used for combining ingredients, beating, whipping, or kneading. Great for cake batter, whipped cream, and bread dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Processor:</strong> A versatile appliance that can chop, slice, shred, grind, and mix. Handles both wet and dry ingredients.</li>
                <li><strong>Microwave Oven:</strong> Cooks food quickly using electromagnetic waves. Excellent for reheating and some cooking tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Toaster/Oven:</strong> Browns bread or bakes small items quickly with focused heat.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Manual Labour-Saving Tools:</strong> Not all helpful tools are electric!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can Opener:</strong> Makes opening cans easy and safe</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic Press:</strong> Crushes garlic quickly without chopping</li>
                <li><strong>Salad Spinner:</strong> Dries greens efficiently after washing</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetable Peeler:</strong> Removes skins quickly and evenly</li>
                <li><strong>Measuring Cups/Spoons:</strong> Ensure accurate amounts without guessing</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Choosing the Right Tool:</strong> Different tasks require different tools. Knowing which appliance to use saves time and gives better results!</p>

                <p>Making a fruit smoothie: A blender can mix frozen fruit, yogurt, and juice into a smooth drink in 60 seconds. Doing this by hand would take much longer and wouldn't be as smooth.</p>
