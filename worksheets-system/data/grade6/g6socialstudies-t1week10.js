            <p>Welcome to our study of how health issues affect our communities and food systems. Today we will explore the relationship between HIV/AIDS and food security.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> HIV and AIDS have significant impacts on food security by affecting both the health of individuals and the agricultural productivity of communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Consequences of HIV/AIDS on Food Security:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced labor force in agriculture due to illness</li>
                <li>Decreased household income for food purchases</li>
                <li>Increased medical expenses reducing money available for food</li>
                <li>Loss of agricultural knowledge when experienced farmers become ill</li>
                <li>Children leaving school to care for sick family members or work in fields</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Health-Agriculture Connection:</strong> When people are healthy, they can work productively in agriculture. When illness strikes a community, both food production and access to nutrition are affected, creating a cycle that's difficult to break.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore pollution - one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing our world today.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Pollution?</strong> Pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate our environment, making it dirty, unsafe, or unhealthy for living things.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Pollution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Harmful gases and particles in the air (from vehicles, factories, burning)</li>
                <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Contaminants in rivers, lakes, and oceans (from chemicals, waste, oil spills)</li>
                <li><strong>Land/Soil Pollution:</strong> Waste materials on or in the ground (from litter, pesticides, industrial waste)</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Pollution:</strong> Excessive or disturbing noise (from traffic, construction, industry)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Major Causes of Pollution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Industrial activities and factory emissions</li>

            <p>Today we will explore various global challenges and think about possible solutions. Understanding these issues helps us become informed global citizens.</p>
            <p><strong>What are Global Challenges?</strong> These are problems that affect people and environments all around the world, often requiring international cooperation to solve.</p>
