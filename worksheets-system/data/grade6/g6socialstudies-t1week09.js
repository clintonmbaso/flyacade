            <p>Welcome to our study of global population challenges! Today we will explore one of the most important issues facing our world today.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The world's population has grown rapidly in recent centuries, creating both opportunities and challenges for humanity.</p>
            <p><strong>Causes of Rapid Population Growth:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved healthcare and medical advances</li>
                <li>Better sanitation and clean water access</li>
                <li>Increased food production and distribution</li>
                <li>Higher birth rates in some regions</li>
                <li>Reduced infant mortality rates</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effects of Rapid Population Growth:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased demand for resources (food, water, energy)</li>
                <li>Urban overcrowding and housing shortages</li>
                <li>Environmental degradation and pollution</li>
                <li>Pressure on educational and healthcare systems</li>
                <li>Higher unemployment rates in some areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Understanding population growth helps us plan for sustainable development and ensure everyone has access to basic needs while protecting our planet.</p>

            <p><strong>What is Corruption?</strong> Corruption is the abuse of power or position for personal gain. It occurs when people in authority use their power dishonestly.</p>
            <p><strong>Forms of Corruption:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bribery:</strong> Offering or accepting money/favors to influence decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Embezzlement:</strong> Stealing money or resources entrusted to you</li>
                <li><strong>Nepotism:</strong> Giving jobs or favors to family/friends instead of qualified people</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Deceiving others for personal gain</li>
                <li><strong>Extortion:</strong> Using threats to obtain money or favors</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Effects of Corruption on Society:</strong></p>
            <ul>
