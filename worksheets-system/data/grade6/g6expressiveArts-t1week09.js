    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we begin our exploration of how athletes and performers build their skills from the ground up. Just as artists practice basic strokes before painting masterpieces, we must develop foundational movement skills before mastering complex sports.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Developmental activities are exercises that build the physical foundation for more advanced skills. They improve coordination, strength, balance, and agility.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Developmental Activities Matter:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build muscle memory for correct movement patterns</li>
            <li>Prevent injury by preparing the body for harder tasks</li>
            <li>Improve overall physical coordination and body awareness</li>
            <li>Create confidence when attempting new skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Movement Stations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obstacle Courses:</strong> Combine crawling, jumping, and balancing to challenge whole-body coordination</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Bars:</strong> Support upper body strength and develop controlled balance</li>
            <li><strong>Circuit Training Areas:</strong> Rotate through strength, agility, and endurance exercises</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Stations:</strong> Use floor lines or low beams to practice stability and posture</li>
            <li><strong>Agility Cones:</strong> Improve quick directional changes and footwork</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Proper Form Fundamentals:</strong> Quality matters more than speed. Keep your back straight, engage your core, land softly when jumping, and move with control through every station.</p>

    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we build on our coordination foundation by practicing sporting skills in parallel format. Working alongside others helps us find rhythm, consistency, and accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Parallel activities mean performing the same skill at the same time as others, moving together to build timing, muscle memory, and controlled repetition.</p>
        <p><strong>Core Skills for Today:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chest Pass (Basketball/Netball):</strong> Hold ball at chest height, step forward, push outward with both hands, follow through with fingers pointing at target</li>
            <li><strong>Ball Dribbling (Football/Hockey):</strong> Keep ball close, use gentle touches, look up between touches, control with inside of foot or flat of stick</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Formation:</strong> Two rows facing each other, equal spacing, synchronized movement</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Accuracy Over Speed:</strong> In parallel drills, precision matters more than how fast you move. Focus on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Correct hand/foot positioning</li>
            <li>Controlled ball movement</li>
            <li>Consistent passing to your partner's target zone</li>
            <li>Maintaining rhythm with your lane partner</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Peer Observation:</strong> Watch your partner's technique. Are they using the correct part of their foot? Is their chest pass coming from the chest or below? Kind feedback helps everyone improve.</p>

    examples: `
        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-basketball-ball"></i> Chest Pass Example</div>
            <p>Stand two meters from your partner. Hold ball at chest, elbows out. Step toward your partner as you push the ball outward, rotating wrists so thumbs point down after release. Aim for your partner's chest area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-futbol"></i> Football Dribbling Example</div>
            <p>In a parallel lane of cones: use the inside of your foot to push the ball gently forward. Keep the ball within 30cm of your feet. Look up between each touch to see the path ahead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-hockey-puck"></i> Hockey Dribbling Example</div>
            <p>Hold stick with both hands, ball in front of body. Push ball gently side-to-side using the flat side of the stick. Keep elbows relaxed and eyes scanning forward between touches.</p>
