            <p>Welcome to our study of democracy! Today we will explore one of the most important systems of government in the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Democracy is a system of government where power comes from the people, either directly or through elected representatives.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Principles of Democracy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equality:</strong> All citizens have equal rights and opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Citizens have the right to take part in decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> Everyone must follow the laws, including leaders</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> Protection of basic rights like speech, assembly, and belief</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Types of Democracy:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong> Citizens vote on every issue directly</li>
                <li><strong>Representative Democracy:</strong> Citizens elect representatives to make decisions for them</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is democracy important?</strong> Democracy allows people to have a say in how they are governed, protects individual rights, and provides peaceful ways to change leadership.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the main characteristics that make a democracy work effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Essential Characteristics of Democracy:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Citizen Participation:</strong> People actively take part in government through voting, discussions, and community involvement</li>
                <li><strong>Majority Rule with Minority Rights:</strong> Decisions are made by majority vote, but the rights of minorities are protected</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Leaders must answer for their actions and decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Government operations and decisions should be open to public scrutiny</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Free Elections:</strong> Citizens choose their leaders through fair elections</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Party System:</strong> Different political parties compete for power</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Participation Matters:</strong> When citizens participate, they ensure their interests are represented and help make better decisions for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>The Rule of Law:</strong> In a democracy, no one is above the law. This ensures justice and equality for all citizens.</p>
            <p><strong>Balancing Act:</strong> Democracy carefully balances the will of the majority with protection for minority groups.</p>
