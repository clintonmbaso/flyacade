            <p>Welcome to our important discussion about teenage pregnancy. Today we will define what teenage pregnancy is and investigate the various factors that can lead to it.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Teenage pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy occurring in a young woman under the age of 20.</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Topic Matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding causes helps prevent teenage pregnancy</li>
                <li>Knowledge empowers young people to make informed choices</li>
                <li>Early pregnancy affects health, education, and future opportunities</li>
                <li>Every young person deserves to reach their full potential</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Investigative Approach:</strong> We will work in groups to explore why teenage pregnancy happens in our communities. Remember to approach this topic with respect and sensitivity.</p>

                <li><strong>Emotional Risks:</strong> Feelings of stress, fear, isolation, or depression that may occur during and after pregnancy.</li>

            <p><strong>Expert Station Approach:</strong> You will work in groups to become experts on one risk category, then share your findings with the class.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While we discuss risks, remember that young parents can be successful with proper support. Our goal is prevention through education.</p>
