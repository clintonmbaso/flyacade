        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our study of the water cycle! Today we will explore how water moves continuously through our environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This cycle has been happening for billions of years!</p>
            <p><strong>The Four Main Stages:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Water turns from liquid to gas (water vapor) due to the sun's heat</li>
                <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Water vapor cools and turns back into liquid droplets, forming clouds</li>
                <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail</li>
                <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Water gathers in oceans, lakes, rivers, and underground</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The Sun's Role:</strong> The sun provides the energy that drives the entire water cycle by heating water and causing evaporation.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is the water cycle important?</strong> It distributes fresh water around the planet, supports all living things, and regulates Earth's temperature.</p>

            <p>Today we will dive deeper into two important processes in the water cycle: evaporation and condensation.</p>
            <p><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The process where liquid water changes into water vapor (gas) due to heat from the sun. This happens when water molecules gain enough energy to escape into the air.</p>
            <p><strong>Condensation:</strong> The opposite process where water vapor cools and changes back into liquid water. This is how clouds form!</p>
            <p><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Wet clothes drying on a line, puddles disappearing after rain, steam from boiling water</li>
                <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Dew on grass in the morning, fog on bathroom mirrors after a shower, clouds in the sky</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Temperature Connection:</strong> Evaporation happens faster in warm conditions, while condensation occurs when warm, moist air meets cooler surfaces.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore how plants use water and how it moves from roots to leaves - nature's amazing plumbing system!</p>
            <p><strong>Root Absorption:</strong> Plant roots have tiny root hairs that absorb water and mineral salts from the soil through a process called osmosis.</p>
            <p><strong>The Xylem:</strong> Special tubes called xylem vessels act like straws, carrying water and minerals upward from roots to leaves.</p>
            <p><strong>Transpiration:</strong> Water evaporates from leaves through tiny pores called stomata. This creates a "pull" that helps draw more water up from the roots.</p>

                <li>Roots absorb water and minerals from soil</li>
