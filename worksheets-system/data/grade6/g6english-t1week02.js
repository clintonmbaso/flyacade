            <p>Welcome to our unit on interviews! This week we will learn how to conduct and participate in interviews effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> An interview is a structured conversation where one person asks questions to get information from another person.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Are Interviews Important?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They help us learn about people and their experiences</li>
                <li>They are used in many professions (journalism, healthcare, business)</li>
                <li>They help us gather important information</li>
                <li>They teach us communication skills</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Different Types of Interviews:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Interviews:</strong> Getting to know someone (like meeting a new friend)</li>
                <li><strong>Radio/News Interviews:</strong> Sharing information with the public</li>
                <li><strong>Service Interviews:</strong> Getting help at places like clinics or police stations</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Today's Hook:</strong> We'll watch a 1-minute clip of a kid-friendly interview and discuss its purpose.</p>
