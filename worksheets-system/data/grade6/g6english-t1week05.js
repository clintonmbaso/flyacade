        <p>Welcome to our English lesson! This week we will explore different types of pronouns that make our language more precise and effective.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will identify and use demonstrative pronouns to point out specific things.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Demonstrative pronouns point to specific nouns and indicate whether they are near or far in distance or time.</p>
        <p><strong>The Four Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>This</strong> - singular and near (e.g., "This is my favorite book.")</li>
            <li><strong>That</strong> - singular and far (e.g., "That is the Eiffel Tower.")</li>
            <li><strong>These</strong> - plural and near (e.g., "These are fresh strawberries.")</li>
            <li><strong>Those</strong> - plural and far (e.g., "Those were the best years of my life.")</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important Distinction:</strong> Demonstrative <em>pronouns</em> stand alone and replace a noun. Demonstrative <em>adjectives</em> modify a noun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pronoun: "I want <strong>this</strong>." (replaces the object)</li>
            <li>Adjective: "I want <strong>this book</strong>." (modifies the noun)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Using demonstrative pronouns correctly helps listeners and readers clearly understand which people, places, or things you are referring to!</p>

    topic: "Interrogative Pronouns",
    subtopic: "Using who, what, where, whose, and which to ask questions",
    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we will learn about interrogative pronouns - the question words that help us gather information about people, places, and things.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will identify and use pronouns that ask questions about people or things.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Interrogative pronouns introduce questions and stand in for the noun we are asking about.</p>
        <p><strong>The Five Main Interrogative Pronouns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who</strong> - asks about people (subject) <em>"Who left their backpack?"</em></li>
            <li><strong>Whom</strong> - asks about people (object) <em>"Whom did you invite?"</em> (formal usage)</li>
            <li><strong>Whose</strong> - asks about possession <em>"Whose car was stolen?"</em></li>
            <li><strong>What</strong> - asks about things or information <em>"What is your favorite subject?"</em></li>
            <li><strong>Which</strong> - asks about choices or selection <em>"Which is the correct answer?"</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note on 'Where':</strong> While 'where' asks about location, it is technically an interrogative adverb, not a pronoun. However, we include it in our question word toolkit!</p>
        <p><strong>Interrogative Pronouns vs. Adjectives:</strong> Like demonstratives, interrogatives can also function as adjectives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pronoun: "<strong>Which</strong> is yours?" (stands alone)</li>
            <li>Adjective: "<strong>Which</strong> backpack is yours?" (modifies noun)</li>
        </ul>

            <p>This question uses the interrogative pronoun <strong>whose</strong> to ask about possession.</p>
            <p>The pronoun represents the unknown owner. The answer might be: "It was <strong>Mr. Chen's</strong> car" or simply "<strong>His</strong>."</p>
            <p><strong>Grammar Check:</strong> "Whose" is always about ownership. Never use "who's" (contraction for "who is") when asking about possession!</p>

    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we will explore reflexive pronouns - special words that reflect back to the subject of the sentence.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will understand pronouns that refer back to the subject of the sentence.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of the sentence are the same person or thing.</p>
        <p><strong>The Complete List of Reflexive Pronouns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Myself</strong> - I taught <strong>myself</strong> to play guitar.</li>
            <li><strong>Yourself</strong> - You should be proud of <strong>yourself</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Himself</strong> - He made <strong>himself</strong> a sandwich.</li>
            <li><strong>Herself</strong> - She controlled <strong>herself</strong> during the argument.</li>
            <li><strong>Itself</strong> - The cat cleaned <strong>itself</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Ourselves</strong> - We prepared <strong>ourselves</strong> for the competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Yourselves</strong> - You should all behave <strong>yourselves</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Themselves</strong> - They organized <strong>themselves</strong> into teams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Two Main Uses of Reflexive Pronouns:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As the object</strong> (when subject and object are same): "The baby saw <strong>herself</strong> in the mirror."</li>
            <li><strong>For emphasis</strong>: "I <strong>myself</strong> witnessed the accident."</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Avoid using reflexives as subjects! "Myself and John went to the store" is incorrect. Use "John and I" instead.</p>

            <p><strong>She controlled herself.</strong> → The subject (she) and the object (herself) are the same person.</p>
            <p>More examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I accidentally cut <strong>myself</strong> while chopping vegetables."</li>

                <li>"Did you paint the entire mural by <strong>yourself</strong>?"</li>
                <li>"The children entertained <strong>themselves</strong> for hours."</li>

        <div class="example-box">
            <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Reflexive for Emphasis</div>
            <p>Sometimes reflexive pronouns add emphasis to a noun or pronoun:</p>
            <p>"The principal <strong>herself</strong> came to our classroom."</p>
            <p>"I <strong>myself</strong> have never been to Hawaii."</p>
            <p>"They <strong>themselves</strong> admitted it was a mistake."</p>
            <p><em>These sentences would be grammatically correct without the reflexive, but the reflexive adds intensity!</em></p>

    lessonContent: `
        <p>Today we will combine everything we've learned! We'll construct complex sentences that use demonstrative, interrogative, and reflexive pronouns together.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will construct complex sentences using multiple types of pronouns.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Fluent writers and speakers naturally combine different pronoun types to express ideas clearly and efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>Pronoun Types Review:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demonstrative:</strong> this, that, these, those (point to specific things)</li>
            <li><strong>Interrogative:</strong> who, whom, whose, what, which (ask questions)</li>
            <li><strong>Reflexive:</strong> myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves (reflect back to subject)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Combined Sentence Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"<strong>That</strong> is my mother and <strong>she</strong> controlled <strong>herself</strong>." (Demonstrative + Reflexive)</li>
            <li>"<strong>Who</strong> taught <strong>themselves</strong> to play <strong>these</strong> instruments?" (Interrogative + Reflexive + Demonstrative)</li>
            <li>"<strong>This</strong> is the student <strong>whose</strong> project won first place, and <strong>she</strong> designed it <strong>herself</strong>." (Demonstrative + Interrogative + Reflexive)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Mastering different pronoun types allows you to write sophisticated, varied sentences that keep readers engaged!</p>

        <p>Today is our Pronoun Identification Workshop! We'll apply everything we've learned this week by identifying and categorizing pronouns in a narrative text.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Students will identify demonstrative, interrogative, and reflexive pronouns within a narrative.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Being able to recognize pronoun types in authentic texts helps us understand how skilled writers use them to create clarity and emphasis.</p>
        <p><strong>Review of Pronoun Types:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demonstrative:</strong> Point to specific things (this, that, these, those)</li>
            <li><strong>Interrogative:</strong> Ask questions (who, whom, whose, what, which)</li>
            <li><strong>Reflexive:</strong> Reflect back to the subject (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves)</li>
        </ul>
