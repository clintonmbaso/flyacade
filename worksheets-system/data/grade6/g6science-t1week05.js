            <p>Welcome to our study of Tuberculosis (TB)! Today we will explore what causes TB, its symptoms, and how it spreads from person to person.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> TB is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that primarily affects the lungs.</p>
            <p><strong>The Cause:</strong> Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Signs & Symptoms:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Chest pain and coughing up blood</li>
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Weight loss and loss of appetite</li>
                <li>Fever and night sweats</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, releasing tiny droplets containing the bacteria.</p>

                <li><strong>Immune-compromised individuals:</strong> People with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or undergoing chemotherapy</li>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Patients take a combination of antibiotics for 6-9 months</li>

            <p><strong>The Importance of Empathy:</strong> TB patients often face stigma and discrimination, which can affect their recovery.</p>
            <p><strong>Ways to Show Support:</strong></p>

                <li>Educate others about TB to reduce fear and misinformation</li>
