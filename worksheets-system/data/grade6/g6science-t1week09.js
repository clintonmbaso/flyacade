            <p>Welcome to our exploration of community water systems! This week we will investigate where our water comes from, how it's made safe, and how we can design better systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Centralized vs. Decentralized Water Systems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centralized Systems:</strong> Large-scale systems managed by cities or towns that pipe treated water to many homes and buildings</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Systems:</strong> Smaller, localized sources like boreholes, wells, streams, or rainwater collection</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Questions for Today:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>What water sources exist in our community?</li>
                <li>How does water get from its source to our taps?</li>
                <li>What are the advantages and challenges of different water systems?</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Different communities use different systems based on their location, population, and resources. Understanding these helps us appreciate this vital resource.</p>

            <p>Today we investigate how water is treated to make it safe for drinking. Different water sources require different treatment methods.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Water Treatment Methods:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Passing water through sand, gravel, or special filters to remove particles</li>
                <li><strong>Chlorination:</strong> Adding small amounts of chlorine to kill harmful bacteria and viruses</li>
                <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Heating water to 100°C to kill microorganisms</li>
                <li><strong>Sedimentation:</strong> Letting water sit so heavy particles settle to the bottom</li>
                <li><strong>UV Treatment:</strong> Using ultraviolet light to disinfect water</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Treatment is Essential:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Untreated water can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites</li>
                <li>Chemical pollutants from industry or agriculture can make water unsafe</li>
                <li>Sediment and particles can affect water taste and appearance</li>
                <li>Proper treatment prevents waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid</li>
