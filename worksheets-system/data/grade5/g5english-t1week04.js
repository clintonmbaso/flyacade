            <p><strong>Phrases for expressing condolences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Please accept my condolences" - A formal and respectful way to express sympathy</li>

                <li>"My thoughts are with you" - Shows you're thinking about them</li>

            <p>Today we will learn different ways to express gratitude and appreciation in social settings.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Expressing appreciation strengthens relationships and creates positive social environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Beyond "thank you":</strong> While "thank you" is always appropriate, we can use more specific and sincere expressions.</p>
            <p><strong>Formal expressions of appreciation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I truly appreciate your help."</li>
                <li>"Thank you very much for your kindness."</li>
                <li>"I am grateful for your support."</li>
                <li>"Your assistance means a great deal to me."</li>
                <li>"I cannot thank you enough for..."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Casual vs. formal appreciation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Casual:</strong> "Thanks!" "I owe you one!" "You're the best!"</li>
                <li><strong>Formal:</strong> "I sincerely appreciate..." "Thank you for your generous..." "I am deeply grateful for..."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When to use different expressions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Casual: With friends, for small favors</li>
                <li>Formal: With teachers, for significant help, in written notes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Being specific:</strong> Instead of just saying "thank you," mention what specifically you're thankful for: "Thank you for helping me understand the math problem" instead of just "Thanks for the help."</p>
            <p><strong>The impact of appreciation:</strong> When we express gratitude, it makes both the giver and receiver feel valued and respected.</p>
