            <p>Welcome to our exploration of human rights in society. Today we will examine why sometimes people cannot fully enjoy their rights and what challenges they face.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Human rights are basic rights and freedoms that belong to every person, but sometimes various factors prevent people from enjoying them fully.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Factors That Hinder Rights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> When leaders misuse power for personal gain</li>
                <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> Lack of basic needs can limit access to rights</li>
                <li><strong>Conflicts and Wars:</strong> Violence disrupts normal life and rights</li>
                <li><strong>Discrimination:</strong> Unfair treatment based on race, gender, or religion</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Education:</strong> Not knowing your rights makes it hard to claim them</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When people cannot enjoy their rights, it affects not only them but the whole society. Communities become less peaceful, less fair, and less prosperous.</p>

                <p>Imagine a family that cannot afford school fees. Even though education is a right, poverty prevents the children from going to school. This affects their future opportunities.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Case Study</div>
                <p>In some places, corruption means that public services like healthcare or clean water are not provided equally. Some people get better services while others suffer.</p>

                <p>When rights are hindered, communities struggle to develop. People cannot reach their full potential, and society loses out on their talents and contributions.</p>
