            <p>Welcome to our study of puberty! Today we will explore what puberty is and why it is a natural and important part of growing up.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Puberty is a normal stage of development when a child's body begins to develop and change as they become an adult.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Puberty?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Puberty is a natural process that happens to everyone</li>
                <li>It usually begins between ages 8-14, but timing varies for each person</li>
                <li>It's controlled by hormones - chemical messengers in our bodies</li>
                <li>Both boys and girls go through puberty, but their changes are different</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Does Puberty Happen?</strong> Puberty prepares our bodies for adulthood. It's a sign that we're transitioning from childhood to adolescence.</p>
            <p><strong>Classroom Rule:</strong> Our classroom is a safe space where we can ask questions respectfully and listen to each other without judgment.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about the physical changes that girls experience during puberty. Remember, these changes are natural and happen to everyone at different times.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Physical Changes for Girls:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Breast Development:</strong> Girls may notice their breasts beginning to grow. This usually happens between ages 8-13.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Hair:</strong> Hair grows under arms and in the pubic area. This is normal and helps protect the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Menstruation (Periods):</strong> Usually starting between ages 10-15, this is when a girl's body prepares for possible pregnancy each month.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin Changes:</strong> Oil glands become more active, which can lead to acne or pimples.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Odor:</strong> Sweat glands become more active, making regular bathing important.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every girl develops at her own pace - there's no "right" time for these changes</li>

            <p>Today we will learn about the physical changes that boys experience during puberty. Like girls, boys go through natural changes as they grow into adults.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Physical Changes for Boys:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Voice Changes:</strong> Boys' voices become deeper as their vocal cords grow longer and thicker.</li>
                <li><strong>Body and Facial Hair:</strong> Hair grows under arms, in the pubic area, and eventually on the face.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth of Reproductive Organs:</strong> The penis and testes increase in size as part of normal development.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin Changes:</strong> Increased oil production can lead to acne, just like in girls.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Odor:</strong> Sweat glands become more active, requiring regular bathing and hygiene.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boys usually start puberty slightly later than girls, typically between ages 9-14</li>
                <li>Growth spurts are common - boys may grow several inches in a year</li>
                <li>All these changes are normal and healthy</li>
                <li>Everyone develops at their own pace</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Understanding Body Odor:</strong> During puberty, sweat glands become more active and produce different chemicals. Bacteria on skin break down this sweat, causing body odor. Good hygiene helps manage this.</p>
