            <p>Welcome to our exploration of Zambia's amazing wildlife! Today we will learn about the incredible animals that call Zambia home.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Zambia is home to some of Africa's most spectacular wildlife, living in diverse habitats from national parks to river systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Major Wildlife Animals in Zambia:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elephants:</strong> Africa's largest land mammals, found in South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi</li>
                <li><strong>Lions:</strong> The "king of the jungle" living in prides in Zambia's savannahs</li>
                <li><strong>Hippopotamuses:</strong> Semi-aquatic giants found in Zambia's rivers and lakes</li>
                <li><strong>Zebras:</strong> Striped equines grazing in Zambia's grasslands</li>
                <li><strong>Giraffes:</strong> The world's tallest animals browsing on acacia trees</li>
                <li><strong>Crocodiles:</strong> Ancient reptiles living in Zambia's waterways</li>
                <li><strong>Various antelope species:</strong> Including impala, kudu, and waterbuck</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is wildlife important to Zambia?</strong> Wildlife is part of Zambia's natural heritage, attracts tourism (which creates jobs), maintains ecosystem balance, and represents our national identity.</p>
            <p><strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Many Zambian animals are protected in national parks like South Luangwa, Kafue, and Lower Zambezi National Parks.</p>

                <li><strong>Luvale:</strong> In Northwestern Province, known for Makishi masks and initiation ceremonies</li>

            <p><strong>Cultural Harmony:</strong> Despite this diversity, Zambians live together peacefully, respecting each other's traditions while building a united nation.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditions and Ceremonies:</strong> Each tribe has unique ceremonies, like the Bemba's Chisungu, Lozi's Kuomboka, and Luvale's Makishi dances.</p>
