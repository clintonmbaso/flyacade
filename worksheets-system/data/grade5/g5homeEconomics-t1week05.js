            <p>Welcome to our study of food preservation. Today we will explore why we preserve food and how cleanliness plays a crucial role in keeping food safe.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction Activity:</strong> What happens to a tomato if it is left on a table for two weeks? Think about changes you might observe in color, texture, and smell.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Food preservation involves treating and handling food to stop or slow down spoilage while maintaining nutritional value, texture, and flavor.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Do We Preserve Food?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To prevent food from spoiling and becoming unsafe to eat</li>
                <li>To extend the shelf life of seasonal foods</li>
                <li>To reduce food waste</li>
                <li>To make food available during times when it's not in season</li>
                <li>To save money by buying in bulk and preserving for later use</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Importance of Cleanliness in Food Preservation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean containers prevent contamination by harmful bacteria</li>
                <li>Sterilizing equipment kills microorganisms that can spoil food</li>
                <li>Proper storage conditions (like correct temperature) slow bacterial growth</li>
                <li>Clean hands and surfaces prevent the spread of germs</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Rules for Food Preservation:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Always start with fresh, high-quality food</li>
                <li>Use clean equipment and containers</li>
                <li>Follow proper methods for the type of food being preserved</li>
                <li>Store preserved foods in appropriate conditions</li>
                <li>Label preserved foods with the date</li>
            </ol>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will explore different food preservation methods through hands-on experimentation. You'll discover how simple techniques can keep food safe to eat for longer periods.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction Review:</strong> Remember our three basic preservation methods: drying, salting, and smoking. Each method works by creating conditions where harmful bacteria cannot grow easily.</p>
            <p><strong>The Science Behind Preservation Methods:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Removes moisture that bacteria need to grow. Without water, microorganisms cannot survive or multiply.</li>
                <li><strong>Salting:</strong> Salt draws moisture out of food through osmosis. It also creates an environment too salty for most bacteria to survive.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Combines drying with chemicals from smoke that have antimicrobial properties, helping to preserve and flavor food.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practical Experiment Setup:</strong> We will conduct a small-scale preservation experiment using safe, simple methods you can observe over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Always work with clean hands and surfaces. Use safe food handling practices. Our experiments will use methods that don't require heat or sharp tools.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Observe:</strong> As food is preserved, you'll notice changes in texture, color, size, and sometimes smell. These changes are normal and show the preservation process working.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-sun" style="color: #FFD700;"></i> Drying Example</div>
                <p>Raisins are dried grapes. The sun or dehydrators remove water, making the grapes smaller, sweeter, and able to last months without refrigeration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-mortar-pestle"></i> Salting Example</div>
                <p>Salt fish or salted meats have been preserved for centuries. The salt penetrates the food, preventing bacterial growth while adding flavor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i> Smoking Example</div>
                <p>Smoked salmon or smoked meats have a distinctive flavor and longer shelf life due to the combined effects of drying and smoke chemicals.</p>
