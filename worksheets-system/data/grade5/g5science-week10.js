            <p>Welcome to Week 10 of Science! This week, we'll explore how fertilizers help plants grow and learn about different types of fertilizers.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Fertilizers are materials added to soil to provide essential nutrients that plants need to grow healthy and strong.</p>
            <p><strong>Two Main Types:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Made from natural materials like plant waste, animal manure, or compost</li>
                <li><strong>Inorganic Fertilizers:</strong> Also called chemical fertilizers, made in factories with specific nutrient ratios</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Plants Need Fertilizers:</strong> Just like we need food to grow, plants need nutrients from the soil. When soil doesn't have enough nutrients, fertilizers help supply them.</p>

            <p>Today we'll learn how to turn waste into valuable fertilizer through composting! This is an important environmental practice.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Compost?</strong> Compost is a dark, crumbly, earthy-smelling material produced by the natural decomposition of organic materials.</p>
            <p><strong>How Compost Helps Plants:</strong> It provides essential nutrients, improves soil structure, helps soil retain moisture, and supports healthy microorganisms.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Continuous Supply is Important:</strong> Plants use nutrients continuously as they grow. Regular composting ensures soil remains fertile season after season.</p>
            <p><strong>Steps to Create Compost:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a location (shady spot, well-drained)</li>
                <li>Collect organic materials (greens and browns)</li>
                <li>Layer materials in your compost bin</li>
                <li>Maintain moisture and turn regularly</li>
