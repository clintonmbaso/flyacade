            <p>Today we will learn about harmful substances that can damage our health. It's important to understand what these substances are and how to stay safe.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Harmful substances are materials that can hurt our bodies when we use them. Some are legal (licit) and some are illegal (illicit).</p>
            <p><strong>Licit Drugs:</strong> Legal substances that can still be harmful, like alcohol (for adults), tobacco, and certain medicines when not used properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Illicit Drugs:</strong> Illegal substances that are never safe to use, like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs that are against the law.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Just because something is legal doesn't mean it's safe, especially for children and teenagers!</p>

            <p>Today we focus specifically on alcohol – what it is, how it affects the body, and why it's particularly dangerous for young people.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Alcohol?</strong> Alcohol is a chemical found in drinks like beer, wine, and liquor. It's a depressant that slows down brain function.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is Alcohol Dangerous for Youth?</strong> Young people's brains are still developing. Alcohol can interfere with this development, affecting memory, learning, and decision-making.</p>
            <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> Even small amounts of alcohol can have negative effects. Large amounts or regular use can cause serious health problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Alcohol and Violence/Accidents:</strong> Alcohol impairs judgment and coordination, leading to increased risk of accidents, violence, and risky behaviors.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Alcohol is illegal for people under the legal drinking age (usually 18 or 21) for good reasons – to protect developing brains and bodies.</p>
