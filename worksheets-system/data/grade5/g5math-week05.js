            <p>Today we will learn how multiplication is essentially repeated addition. This is a fundamental concept that connects what you already know about addition to multiplication!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Multiplication means adding the same number multiple times. For example, 3 × 4 means adding 3 four times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.</p>
            <p>When we write multiplication problems, we use the <strong>× sign</strong> (times) and sometimes a <strong>•</strong> (dot) or parentheses.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You can use objects like blocks, counters, or toys to help you visualize multiplication!</p>

            <p>Today we will build on yesterday's concept and start memorizing basic multiplication facts, beginning with the 2 and 3 times tables. Memorizing these facts will make math faster and easier!</p>
