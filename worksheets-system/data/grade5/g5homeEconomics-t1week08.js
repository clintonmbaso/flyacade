        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our lesson on kitchen creativity! Today we will learn how to cook with what we have, even if we don't have all the standard tools or ingredients.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What do we do if we don't have a rolling pin? What if wheat flour is too expensive? Good cooks learn to be resourceful!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Innovation means finding new ways to do things. Improvisation means using what's available instead of what's "supposed" to be used.</p>
            <p><strong>Substituting Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use cassava flour or maize flour instead of wheat flour</li>
                <li>Use honey or mashed bananas instead of sugar in some recipes</li>
                <li>Use yogurt instead of buttermilk</li>
                <li>Use vegetable oil instead of butter (in some recipes)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Improvising Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a clean glass bottle as a rolling pin</li>
                <li>Use a tin can as a biscuit cutter (smooth the edges!)</li>
                <li>Use a heavy pot with a lid as a Dutch oven</li>
                <li>Use a fork or clean hands instead of a mixer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Being resourceful helps us cook even when we don't have everything. It saves money, reduces waste, and makes us better problem-solvers!</p>

                <p>In many African countries, cassava flour is used instead of wheat flour to make fufu, bread, and other dishes. It's local, affordable, and nutritious!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today is a practical cooking lesson! We will prepare flour mixtures using raising agents to make our dishes light and fluffy.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Before we begin, let's review safety and hygiene:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash hands thoroughly with soap</li>
                <li>Tie back long hair</li>
                <li>Wear an apron if available</li>
                <li>Clean all surfaces and utensils</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What are Raising Agents?</strong> These are ingredients that make baked goods rise by creating gas bubbles. Yeast and baking powder are common raising agents.</p>
            <p><strong>Practical Task:</strong> Prepare a simple flour mixture. Choose Option A or B:</p>
            <p><strong>Option A (Yeast):</strong> Making simple buns or bread rolls</p>
            <p><strong>Option B (Baking Powder):</strong> Making pancakes or scones</p>
            <p><strong>Steps for Success:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Measuring:</strong> Measure ingredients accurately using proper cups or scales</li>
                <li><strong>Sifting:</strong> Sift flour to remove lumps and incorporate air</li>
                <li><strong>Adding:</strong> Add the raising agent and liquids gradually</li>
                <li><strong>Mixing/Kneading:</strong> Mix or knead to the right consistency (not too sticky, not too dry)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yeast needs warm (not hot) liquid to activate</li>
                <li>Don't overmix baking powder recipes - just until combined</li>
                <li>Let yeast dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size</li>
                <li>Bake immediately after mixing baking powder recipes</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-bread-slice" style="color: #8B4513;"></i> Yeast Example</div>
                <p>Yeast is a living organism! When mixed with warm water and sugar, it produces carbon dioxide gas that makes bread dough rise and become light and airy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-pancakes"></i> Baking Powder Example</div>
                <p>Baking powder contains both an acid and a base. When mixed with liquid, they react to create bubbles immediately, making pancakes and scones rise quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Measurement Example</div>
                <p>In baking, measurements matter! Too much baking powder makes food taste bitter. Too little yeast and bread won't rise properly.</p>
