            <p>Today we will explore why water is essential for soil and plant life. Without water in the soil, plants cannot grow and survive!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Water in the soil helps with two critical processes: <strong>seed germination</strong> and <strong>photosynthesis</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Germination:</strong> When seeds absorb water, they swell up and begin to sprout. This is the first step in a plant's life cycle.</p>
            <p><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Plants use water from the soil to make their own food through photosynthesis. Water travels from the roots up to the leaves.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Water also helps dissolve nutrients in the soil so plant roots can absorb them!</p>

                <p>A dry bean seed remains dormant. When placed in moist soil, it absorbs water, swells, and the root (radicle) emerges within days.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we'll learn how to keep water in the soil longer — this is called <strong>water retention</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Good water retention means plants have water available even during dry periods.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods to improve retention:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Covering soil with straw, leaves, or plastic to reduce evaporation.</li>
                <li><strong>Shading:</strong> Using trees or cloth to protect soil from direct sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Terracing:</strong> Creating flat steps on slopes to slow water runoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Weeding:</strong> Removing weeds so they don’t steal water from crops.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Different soil types hold water differently. Clay holds more, sand holds less.</p>
