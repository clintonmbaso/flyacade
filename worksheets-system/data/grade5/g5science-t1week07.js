            <p>Welcome to our study of nutrition! Today we will explore the six main nutrients that make up our food and how they help our bodies function.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Nutrients are the building blocks in food that our bodies need to grow, repair, and stay healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>The Six Main Nutrients:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Building blocks for growth and repair of body tissues</li>
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Main source of energy for our bodies</li>
                <li><strong>Fats/Oils:</strong> Provide energy, protect organs, and help absorb vitamins</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamins:</strong> Help with various body functions and prevent diseases</li>
                <li><strong>Minerals:</strong> Build strong bones and teeth, help nerves function</li>
                <li><strong>Dietary Fibre:</strong> Helps digestion and keeps our digestive system healthy</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why Do We Need All Six Nutrients?</strong> Each nutrient has a special job. Just like a car needs different parts to run, our bodies need all six nutrients to work properly!</p>

            <p>Today we become food scientists! We will learn how to test foods to find out what nutrients they contain.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Test Food?</strong> Food tests help us understand what we're eating and make healthy choices.</p>
            <p><strong>The Grease Spot Test for Fats and Oils:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rub a small piece of food on brown paper (like a paper bag)</li>
                <li>Let it dry for 2-3 minutes</li>
                <li>Hold the paper up to the light</li>
                <li>If you see a translucent (see-through) spot, the food contains fat or oil</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Other Food Tests:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starch Test:</strong> Add iodine solution to food. If it turns blue-black, starch is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Protein Test:</strong> Biuret solution turns purple in the presence of protein.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar Test:</strong> Benedict's solution turns orange/red when heated with sugars.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Always wash hands before and after handling food. Some tests require adult supervision.</p>
