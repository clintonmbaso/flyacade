            <p>Welcome to our lesson on the internal changes during puberty. Today we will learn about how growing up affects our feelings, friendships, and social interactions.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Puberty involves not only physical changes but also important social and emotional changes that help us mature into young adults.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Social Changes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendships may change as interests develop</li>
                <li>Increased awareness of peer opinions and possible peer pressure</li>
                <li>Desire for more independence from family</li>
                <li>Formation of closer, more meaningful friendships</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common Emotional Changes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mood swings – feeling happy one moment and sad or irritable the next</li>
                <li>Increased sensitivity to criticism or rejection</li>
                <li>Stronger feelings of embarrassment or self-consciousness</li>
                <li>Developing a clearer sense of personal identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are these changes normal?</strong> Emotional and social changes during puberty are natural as your brain matures and you begin to understand yourself and others better.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn practical skills to maintain cleanliness and health during puberty. Good hygiene helps you feel confident and prevents infections.</p>
            <p><strong>Daily Hygiene Basics for Everyone:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bathing Regularly:</strong> Shower or bathe daily, especially after physical activity. Use mild soap and warm water.</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaning Specific Areas:</strong> Pay special attention to armpits, genital areas, and feet where sweat and bacteria collect.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Clothes:</strong> Change underwear daily and wear clean clothes. Natural fabrics like cotton allow skin to breathe.</li>
                <li><strong>Deodorant/Antiperspirant:</strong> Consider using deodorant as sweat glands become more active during puberty.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Menstrual Hygiene (for those who menstruate):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Menstruation is a normal, healthy process where the uterus sheds its lining</li>
                <li>Wash hands before and after changing sanitary products</li>
                <li>Change pads/tampons regularly (every 4-6 hours)</li>
                <li>Wrap used pads properly before disposal</li>
                <li>Track menstrual cycles to anticipate periods</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important Fact:</strong> Good hygiene prevents body odor, skin infections, and helps you feel fresh and confident throughout the day.</p>
