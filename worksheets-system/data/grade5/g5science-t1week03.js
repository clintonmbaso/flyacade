            <p>Welcome to our study of the skeletal system! Today we will explore the five main functions of our bones and why they are so important for our bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>The Five Main Functions of Bones:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Bones provide a framework that supports our body, just like beams support a house.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Bones protect delicate organs (skull protects brain, ribs protect heart and lungs).</li>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Bones give our body its unique human shape and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Bones act as levers that muscles pull on to create movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Cell Production:</strong> Bone marrow inside bones produces red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Special Focus: Bone Marrow</strong></p>
            <p>Bone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue inside some bones. It works like a factory producing:
            • Red blood cells (carry oxygen)
            • White blood cells (fight infections)
            • Platelets (help blood clot)</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Without bone marrow, our bodies couldn't make new blood cells, which are essential for life!</p>

                <p>Just as a house needs beams and pillars to stand, your body needs bones for support. Try standing without your skeleton - you'd collapse like a jellyfish!</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Protection in Action</div>
                <p>Your rib cage is like a protective cage around your heart and lungs. Your skull is like a helmet for your brain - both keeping vital organs safe.</p>

            <p>Today we will compare and contrast human skeletons with other vertebrate animals. All vertebrates have backbones, but their skeletons have adapted to different needs!</p>
            <p><strong>Similarities Across Vertebrates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most mammals have the same basic bone structure</li>
                <li>All have a backbone (vertebral column)</li>
                <li>All have skulls to protect the brain</li>
                <li>Most have four limbs (though some are modified)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Differences and Adaptations:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Birds:</strong> Have hollow bones to make them lighter for flight. Their breastbone (sternum) is large for flight muscle attachment.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Have many small bones (especially in bony fish). Their skeletons are streamlined for swimming.</li>
                <li><strong>Mammals:</strong> Have solid bones. Different mammals have adaptations - bats have elongated finger bones for wings, whales have modified arm bones for flippers.</li>
                <li><strong>Reptiles:</strong> Often have extra bones in their skulls. Some have bony plates or scales.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Finding Equivalent Bones:</strong> Even though animals look different, we can often find the same bones. For example, the humerus in human arms is similar to the humerus in dog legs, bird wings, and whale flippers!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about bone health and create our own skeletal models! Understanding how to keep bones healthy is as important as understanding how they work.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Bone Conditions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fractures:</strong> Broken bones that need time to heal. Different types include simple, compound, and hairline fractures.</li>
                <li><strong>Rickets:</strong> A childhood disease caused by lack of Vitamin D and calcium, leading to soft, weak bones that can bend.</li>
                <li><strong>Osteoporosis:</strong> An adult condition where bones become brittle and fragile from loss of tissue, often due to aging or poor nutrition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Keeping Bones Healthy:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Found in dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> From sunlight, fish, eggs, and fortified milk (helps absorb calcium)</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Weight-bearing activities like running and jumping strengthen bones</li>
                <li><strong>Good Posture:</strong> Sitting and standing properly helps maintain bone alignment</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Model Building Tip:</strong> When creating your skeletal model, think about how bones connect at joints. Some joints move (like knees) while others don't (like skull sutures).</p>
