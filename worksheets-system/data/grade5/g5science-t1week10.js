            <p>Welcome to our lesson on preventing parasitic diseases! Today we will explore how to keep our community healthy by stopping parasites from spreading.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Parasites are organisms that live on or in another organism (the host) and get their food from the host. They can cause diseases like malaria, worms, and skin infections.</p>
            <p><strong>How Parasites Spread:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Through contaminated water or food</li>
                <li>Through insect bites (like mosquitoes)</li>
                <li>Through poor personal hygiene</li>
                <li>Through unclean environments that breed parasites</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is prevention important?</strong> Preventing parasitic diseases keeps our community healthy, allows children to attend school regularly, and helps adults work productively.</p>
