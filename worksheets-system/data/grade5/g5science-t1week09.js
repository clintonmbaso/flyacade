            <p>Welcome to our health awareness unit! Today we will learn about harmful substances that some people misuse in our community and why this is dangerous.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Substance abuse means using drugs or other substances in ways that are harmful to your health or not following medical advice.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Harmful Substances:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Can damage the liver and brain, affecting judgment and coordination</li>
                <li><strong>Marijuana (Cannabis):</strong> Affects memory, learning, and can lead to breathing problems</li>
                <li><strong>Cocaine:</strong> Highly addictive substance that can cause heart problems and mental health issues</li>
                <li><strong>Solvents (Inhalants):</strong> Chemicals found in glue, paint, or gasoline that can cause brain damage and organ failure</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is substance abuse harmful?</strong> These substances can change how your brain works, damage your body, and affect your relationships with family and friends.</p>

            <p>Today we shift from substance abuse to another health topic: parasitic diseases common in many communities. These are illnesses caused by parasites living in or on our bodies.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Malaria:</strong> Caused by a parasite spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, chills, and fatigue.</li>

                <li><strong>Anthrax:</strong> Caused by bacteria that can infect animals and humans through contact or contaminated food.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow Fever:</strong> Viral disease spread by mosquitoes, causing fever and sometimes liver damage.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Understanding Vectors:</strong> Many parasitic diseases are spread by "vectors" - animals (usually insects) that carry and transmit the disease to humans.</p>
