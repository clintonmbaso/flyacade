            <p>Today we will learn about malaria, a serious disease that affects many people. Understanding what causes malaria and how it spreads is important for our health.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Malaria is caused by parasites called Plasmodium that are transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.</p>
            <p><strong>How Malaria Spreads:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mosquito bites a person with malaria and picks up the parasite</li>
                <li>Mosquito bites another person, injecting the parasite into their bloodstream</li>
                <li>The parasite multiplies in the liver and red blood cells</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Malaria is NOT spread by touching, sharing food, or being near someone with malaria. Only mosquitoes can spread it!</p>
