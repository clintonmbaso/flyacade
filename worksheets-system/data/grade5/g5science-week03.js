            <p>Welcome to our lesson on puberty! Today we will learn about our bodies in a respectful and educational way.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify and name the private and non-private parts of the male and female body</li>
                <li>Understand the importance of personal hygiene for private parts</li>
                <li>Learn the significance of respecting others' boundaries and privacy</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Our bodies have different parts, some are private and some are not. Knowing about them helps us take better care of ourselves and respect others.</p>
            <p><strong>Private parts</strong> are those covered by swimsuits or underwear. We keep these private and don't show them to others except for medical reasons with a trusted adult present.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-private parts</strong> include arms, legs, face, and hands—parts we can show in public.</p>
