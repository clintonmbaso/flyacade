            <p>Welcome to our exploration of gender in society! Today we will learn important concepts that help us understand ourselves and others better.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Biological differences between males and females (like body parts you're born with).</li>
                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Social and cultural roles, behaviors, and expectations that society considers appropriate for boys/men and girls/women.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender Roles:</strong> Expectations about how people should behave based on their gender.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Distinctions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sex is about biology (nature), while gender is about society and culture (nurture).</li>
                <li>Gender roles can change over time and differ across cultures.</li>
                <li>What's considered "for boys" or "for girls" varies in different places and times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cultural Differences:</strong> In some cultures, cooking is seen as women's work, while in others, men are the main chefs. Some societies have flexible gender roles, while others have very strict ones.</p>

                <p>In Norway, both men and women commonly take parental leave to care for babies. In some countries, only women are expected to do this.</p>

                <p>100 years ago, teaching was mostly done by men. Today, most teachers are women. Gender roles can and do change!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about gender discrimination and how we can promote equality for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gender Discrimination:</strong> Treating someone unfairly or differently because of their gender.</li>
                <li><strong>Forms of Discrimination:</strong> Can include unequal opportunities, unfair rules, stereotypes, or exclusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Effects of Discrimination:</strong> Makes people feel hurt, limits their potential, creates unfair societies.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender Equality:</strong> When all genders have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Examples of Gender Discrimination:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saying "boys can't cry" or "girls aren't good at math"</li>
                <li>Not letting someone join an activity because of their gender</li>
                <li>Paying someone less for the same work because of their gender</li>
                <li>Making fun of someone for not following traditional gender roles</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Promoting Equality:</strong> We can challenge stereotypes, speak up against unfair treatment, and support everyone's right to be themselves.</p>
