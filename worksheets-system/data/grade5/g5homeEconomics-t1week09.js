            <p>Welcome to our lesson on kitchen cleanliness! Today we will learn why a clean kitchen is essential for health and safety, and how to properly clean different kitchen surfaces.</p>
            <p><strong>Why a Clean Kitchen Matters:</strong> A clean kitchen prevents the spread of germs, keeps food safe to eat, and makes cooking more pleasant. Proper cleaning also helps your kitchen equipment last longer.</p>
            <p><strong>Wooden Furniture:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a slightly damp (not wet) cloth to avoid water damage</li>
                <li>Wipe in the direction of the wood grain</li>
                <li>Dry immediately with a clean towel</li>
                <li>Use mild soap - avoid harsh chemicals that can strip the wood</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Glass & Windows:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use microfiber cloths or newspaper for a streak-free finish</li>
                <li>Clean in a circular motion or "S" pattern</li>
                <li>Use vinegar-water solution for natural cleaning</li>
                <li>Dry with a separate clean, dry cloth</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Metals:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove grease with warm soapy water</li>
                <li>For polishing, use appropriate metal polish</li>
                <li>Dry thoroughly to prevent water spots and rust</li>
                <li>For stainless steel, wipe in the direction of the grain</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Principle:</strong> Different materials need different care. Using the wrong cleaning method can damage your kitchen surfaces.</p>

                <p>A wooden cutting board should be cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap, then dried immediately. Never soak it in water or it will warp and crack.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore the kitchen sink - often called the "heart" of kitchen hygiene. We'll learn its parts and how to keep it clean and functioning properly.</p>
            <p><strong>The Importance of Sink Care:</strong> A clean, well-maintained sink prevents germs, odors, and pests. It's where we wash food, dishes, and our hands, so hygiene is crucial.</p>
            <p><strong>Parts of the Sink:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taps/Faucets:</strong> Control water flow - can be separate hot and cold or mixed</li>
                <li><strong>Overflow Outlet:</strong> Prevents sink from overflowing by allowing water to drain</li>
                <li><strong>Draining Board:</strong> Area beside sink where dishes dry</li>
                <li><strong>U-bend/Trap:</strong> Curved pipe under sink that traps debris and prevents sewer gases</li>
                <li><strong>Strainer/Plug:</strong> Catches food particles to prevent blockages</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Daily Maintenance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse sink after each use to prevent stains</li>
                <li>Clean with baking soda and vinegar weekly</li>
                <li>Empty and clean the kitchen bin regularly to prevent odors and pests</li>
                <li>Run hot water down drain weekly to clear grease</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Preventing Blocks:</strong> Never pour these down the sink: cooking grease/oil, coffee grounds, eggshells, or starchy foods like rice and pasta.</p>
            <p><strong>Unblocking Basics:</strong> For minor blocks, use a plunger (force pump) with water covering the rubber cup. Push and pull firmly to create pressure that dislodges the blockage.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-sink" style="color: #4A90E2;"></i> Sink Parts Example</div>
                <p>The U-bend under your sink has a important job: it holds standing water that blocks sewer gases from coming up into your kitchen.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-ban"></i> What Not to Pour Example</div>
                <p>Cooking grease might be liquid when hot, but it solidifies in pipes causing serious blocks. Always wipe pans with paper towel before washing.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-hand-paper"></i> Plunger Use Example</div>
                <p>When using a plunger, ensure the rubber cup covers the drain completely and there's enough water to create suction. 5-10 firm pushes usually clears minor blocks.</p>
