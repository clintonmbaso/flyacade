            <p>Welcome to our lesson on professional service. Today we will learn the formal rules that make dining experiences special beyond just the food.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What makes a "great" dining experience? It's not just about tasty food - it's also about how the food is served and the care shown to guests.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Professional service follows specific rules that show respect and create a pleasant experience for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Priority of Service:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ladies are served first as a sign of respect</li>
                <li>The host or hostess is served last</li>
                <li>If there are no clear hosts, serve the oldest guest first</li>
                <li>Always serve from the guest's right side when possible</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Direction of Service:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the "anti-clockwise" rule: move around the table counter-clockwise</li>
                <li>This creates a smooth, predictable flow of service</li>
                <li>Helps servers avoid bumping into each other</li>
                <li>Makes the experience more organized for guests</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Rules Matter:</strong> Following service rules shows professionalism, respect for guests, and attention to detail that makes any meal special.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how communication and etiquette transform good service into excellent service.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Why does a "smile" matter in housekeeping and service? A smile welcomes guests, shows warmth, and creates a positive atmosphere.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Excellent service combines technical skills with exceptional communication and manners.</p>
            <p><strong>Polite Expressions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always use "please" when taking orders or making requests</li>
                <li>Say "thank you" when receiving something or completing service</li>
                <li>Respond with "you're welcome" when thanked</li>
                <li>Use "excuse me" when interrupting or passing close to guests</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Body Language:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a genuine, welcoming smile</li>
                <li>Stand up straight with shoulders back (good posture)</li>
                <li>Make appropriate eye contact</li>
                <li>Keep hands visible and avoid crossing arms</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Active Listening:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay full attention to the customer</li>
                <li>Nod to show understanding</li>
                <li>Repeat orders back to confirm accuracy</li>
                <li>Notice not just words but tone and body language</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Good communication makes the kitchen and dining area run smoothly, prevents misunderstandings, and ensures guests feel valued.</p>
