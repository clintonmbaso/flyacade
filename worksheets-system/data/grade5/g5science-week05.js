            <p>This week we will learn about diseases that spread through the air and water in Zambia. Understanding how diseases spread helps us protect ourselves and our communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airborne diseases:</strong> Illnesses that spread through tiny droplets in the air when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk</li>
                <li><strong>Waterborne diseases:</strong> Illnesses caused by drinking contaminated water or coming into contact with polluted water</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common diseases in Zambia:</strong> We will identify diseases that affect many people in our country and learn why they are common.</p>
            <p><strong>Spread mechanisms:</strong> Diseases don't just "happen" - they have specific ways of moving from person to person.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Example: How Airborne Diseases Spread</div>
                <p>When someone with tuberculosis coughs without covering their mouth, tiny droplets containing germs float in the air. If you breathe in these droplets, you might get infected.</p>
                <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Think of smoke spreading through a room - germs can spread similarly through the air.</p>

                <p>If human waste contaminates a water source, and someone drinks that water without boiling or treating it, they can get diseases like cholera or typhoid.</p>
                <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Imagine adding a drop of ink to clear water - it spreads and contaminates the whole glass.</p>

            <p>Today we will explore exactly how diseases spread and learn to identify common symptoms. Knowledge is our first defense against illness!</p>
            <p><strong>Airborne Transmission:</strong> These diseases spread through respiratory droplets. Factors like crowded spaces, poor ventilation, and not covering coughs increase spread.</p>
            <p><strong>Waterborne Transmission:</strong> These diseases spread when water sources become contaminated with human or animal waste, chemicals, or other pollutants.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airborne:</strong> Tuberculosis (TB), Influenza (flu), Pneumonia, Common cold</li>
