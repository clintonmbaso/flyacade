            <p>Welcome to Week 4 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to keep our food from spoiling.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Have you ever seen food go bad? What happens to food when we don't keep it properly? Today we'll learn how to keep food fresh and safe to eat.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Fresh food keeps us healthy! We need to store food properly so it doesn't spoil and make us sick.</p>
            <p><strong>Ways to Keep Food Fresh:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cooling</strong> - Some foods need to stay cold in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li><strong>Drying</strong> - Some foods can be dried in the sun to last longer.</li>
                <li><strong>Covering</strong> - Keeping food covered protects it from dirt and insects.</li>
                <li><strong>Eating fresh</strong> - Some foods taste best when eaten right away!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When we keep food properly, it stays tasty and safe for us to eat. It also helps reduce waste!</p>
