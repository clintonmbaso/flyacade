            <p>Welcome to Week 10 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to eat gracefully during snack time and meals.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's share what we like to eat for snack time. Why is it important to eat nicely and politely?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Good eating habits make mealtime pleasant for everyone and help us stay healthy!</p>
            <p><strong>Important Eating Habits:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sit upright</strong> - Keep your back straight and face your food.</li>
                <li><strong>Chew with mouth closed</strong> - This keeps our food inside and looks polite.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't talk while eating</strong> - Wait until you swallow before speaking.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep the table clean</strong> - Wipe up any crumbs or spills.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When we eat politely, we show respect for others and make mealtime a happy time!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about taking only what we need during snack time and meals.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Look at this large bowl of counters/fruit. Should one person take all of them? Why or why not?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Taking only what we need shows we care about others and helps avoid waste!</p>

                <li><strong>Take only enough</strong> - Think about what you can actually eat.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider others</strong> - Leave plenty for your friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Pass politely</strong> - Gently pass the bowl to the next person.</li>
                <li><strong>No waste</strong> - Only take what you will finish.</li>
            </ul>
