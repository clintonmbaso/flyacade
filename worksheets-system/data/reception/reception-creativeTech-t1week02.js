            <p>Welcome to Week 2 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to stay safe when we visit special rooms in our school.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Some rooms in our school have special equipment that helps us learn in different ways. Today we'll visit one of these rooms and learn how to be safe there!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Special rooms need special rules to keep everyone safe. We must listen carefully and follow these rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Safety Rules for Special Rooms:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Walking feet only</strong> – No running in special rooms.</li>
                <li><strong>No food or drinks</strong> – We eat only in the dining area.</li>
                <li><strong>Look with your eyes</strong> – Touch only with teacher's permission.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay with the group</strong> – Never wander away from your class.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Special equipment can be dangerous if we don't use it properly. Following rules keeps everyone safe!</p>

            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> A safe playground is a happy playground! We need to look for things that could hurt us and tell a grown-up.</p>

                <li><strong>Take turns</strong> – Wait for your turn on slides and swings.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch where you're going</strong> – Look ahead when you run or walk.</li>
                <li><strong>Play on soft surfaces</strong> – Stay on grass or rubber mats when possible.</li>
