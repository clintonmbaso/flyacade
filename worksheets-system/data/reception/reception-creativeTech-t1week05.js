            <p>Welcome to Week 5 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to be Litter Heroes who keep our environment clean.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's look around our school. What things should not be on the ground? How can we help keep our school beautiful?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> A clean school is a happy school! When we pick up litter, we care for our environment and keep it safe for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Rules for Litter Heroes:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pick up litter safely</strong> - Use a bag or gloves if available.</li>
                <li><strong>Know where it goes</strong> - Put litter in the right bins.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell a friend</strong> - Remind others to use the bins too.</li>
                <li><strong>Be a role model</strong> - Show others how to be a Litter Hero!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When our school is clean, we can play safely, stay healthy, and show pride in our environment!</p>
