            <p>Welcome to Week 8 of Creative and Technology Studies! This week we will learn about Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Students will identify common ICT devices like phones, cameras, and computers.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Look at this smartphone/laptop. Have you seen one of these at home? What do you think we can do with it?</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> ICT devices help us do many things! They can help us talk to people, take pictures, learn new things, and have fun.</p>
            <p><strong>Common ICT Devices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smartphone</strong> - For calling, texting, and taking pictures</li>
                <li><strong>Tablet</strong> - For playing games, watching videos, and drawing</li>
                <li><strong>Camera</strong> - For capturing special moments</li>
                <li><strong>Computer/Laptop</strong> - For learning, creating, and playing</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> ICT devices are part of our everyday lives. Knowing what they are helps us use them safely and wisely!</p>
