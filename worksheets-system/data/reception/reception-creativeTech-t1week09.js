            <p>Welcome to Week 9 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn about special words that make people feel happy.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's start by greeting each other warmly. How do you feel when someone says "please" or "thank you" to you? Let's share our feelings!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Polite words are like magic words—they make people smile and feel respected.</p>
            <p><strong>Our Magic Words:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>"Please"</strong> - Use when asking for something.</li>
                <li><strong>"Thank you"</strong> - Use when someone gives you something or helps you.</li>
                <li><strong>"Excuse me"</strong> - Use when you need to get someone's attention or pass by.</li>
                <li><strong>"I'm sorry"</strong> - Use when you make a mistake or hurt someone's feelings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When we use magic words, we show kindness and make our classroom a happy place!</p>
