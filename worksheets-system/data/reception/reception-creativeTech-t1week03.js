            <p>Welcome to Week 3 of Creative and Technology Studies! Today we will learn how to cross the road safely together.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> When we are outside, we need to be extra careful near roads. Cars, bicycles, and other vehicles can be dangerous if we don't follow safety rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Always cross the road at a safe place like a zebra crossing, and always with a grown-up!</p>
            <p><strong>Important Road Safety Rules:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Find a safe place</strong> - Look for a zebra crossing or pedestrian crossing.</li>
                <li><strong>Hold hands</strong> - Always hold a grown-up's hand when crossing.</li>
                <li><strong>Look both ways</strong> - Look "Right, Left, Right" before stepping onto the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop, Look, Listen</strong> - Stop at the curb, look both ways, and listen for traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Walk, don't run</strong> - Walk straight across without stopping.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Following these rules helps us stay safe when we are near roads and cars!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to keep our classroom safe and organized by putting tools in their proper places.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Our classroom has many tools we use for learning and creating. When we put them back where they belong, our room stays tidy and safe.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> A place for every tool, and every tool in its place!</p>

                <li><strong>Pencils go sharp-end-down</strong> in the pencil pot.</li>
                <li><strong>Always clean up</strong> after using tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> When tools are stored properly, we can find them easily, they don't get broken, and no one gets hurt by sharp or messy items left out!</p>

            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Most people are kind, but some strangers might not be safe. We need to know what to do if someone we don't know tries to talk to us or give us something.</p>
