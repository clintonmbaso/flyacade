        lessonContent: `
            <p>This week we will learn about telling time on analog clocks! Today we'll focus on quarter-hour intervals.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The clock face is divided into quarters. Each quarter represents 15 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Terms:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quarter past:</strong> 15 minutes after the hour (e.g., 3:15)</li>
                <li><strong>Half past:</strong> 30 minutes after the hour (e.g., 3:30)</li>
                <li><strong>Quarter to:</strong> 15 minutes before the next hour (e.g., 3:45)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The minute hand moves around the clock. When it points to 3, that's 15 minutes past. When it points to 6, that's 30 minutes past. When it points to 9, that's 45 minutes past (or quarter to the next hour).</p>

            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> On a digital clock, we see numbers like 3:15. On an analog clock, we look at where the hands point.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> First find the hour. Then look at the minute hand. If it points to 3 → 15 minutes past, 6 → 30 minutes past, 9 → 45 minutes past.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge yourself:</strong> Try to say the time in two ways. For 4:15, say "four-fifteen" AND "quarter past four."</p>
