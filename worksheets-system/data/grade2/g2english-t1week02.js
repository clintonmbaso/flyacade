            <p>Welcome to our English lesson! Today we will learn about our extended family—the relatives who might live in other houses but are still part of our family.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> An extended family includes relatives beyond our parents and siblings.</p>
            <p><strong>Who is in an extended family?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grandmother</strong> (Grandma) – your mother or father's mother</li>
                <li><strong>Grandfather</strong> (Grandpa) – your mother or father's father</li>
                <li><strong>Aunt</strong> – your mother or father's sister</li>
                <li><strong>Uncle</strong> – your mother or father's brother</li>
                <li><strong>Cousin</strong> – your aunt or uncle's child</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Think About:</strong> Who lives in your house? Now think about relatives who live in other houses. They are your extended family!</p>
            <p><strong>The Family Tree:</strong> Families are like trees with many branches. Each branch is a different relative!</p>

            <p>Today we will practice recognizing extended family members by looking at pictures and understanding the differences between them.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> We can tell family members apart by their age, how they look, and their relationship to us.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Clues:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grandparents</strong> – Usually have gray hair, wear glasses, kind faces</li>
                <li><strong>Aunts & Uncles</strong> – Adults like your parents, but not your parents</li>
                <li><strong>Cousins</strong> – Children around your age, but not your brothers or sisters</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Vocabulary Review:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aunt</strong> – female (your mother or father's sister)</li>
                <li><strong>Uncle</strong> – male (your mother or father's brother)</li>
