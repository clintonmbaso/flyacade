            <p>Welcome to our English lesson! Today we will learn about different jobs that people do in our community.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Every person who works has a special name for their job, which we call an "occupation."</p>
            <p><strong>What is an occupation?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a job that a person does</li>
                <li>Every job helps our community</li>
                <li>Different people have different occupations</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Four important occupations:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Teacher</strong> - works in a school</li>
                <li><strong>Doctor</strong> - works in a hospital</li>
                <li><strong>Farmer</strong> - works on a farm</li>
                <li><strong>Police Officer</strong> - works in the community</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why learn about occupations?</strong> Knowing about different jobs helps us understand how our community works together!</p>
