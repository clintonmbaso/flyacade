            <p>Welcome to our listening and oral comprehension lessons! Today we will practice active listening by focusing on a short story and demonstrating our understanding through drawing.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Active Listening?</strong> Active listening means paying close attention to what you hear, thinking about it, and showing you understand.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Focus:</strong> We will listen to a short story called "The Lost Kitten." Your task is to visualize one specific scene and draw it accurately.</p>
            <p><strong>Listening Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sit quietly and focus on the speaker</li>
                <li>Picture the story in your mind like a movie</li>
                <li>Listen for descriptive words (colors, sizes, actions)</li>
                <li>Remember important details about characters and settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Story Preview:</strong> "The Lost Kitten" is about a girl named Maya who finds a small, striped kitten in her backyard. She needs to find its home while learning about responsibility.</p>

                <p>When you hear "the small, gray kitten with white paws," you should picture exactly how the kitten looks. What size is small? What shade of gray? How many white paws?</p>

            <p>Today we will learn about the 5W+H questions: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. These questions help us understand information completely.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>WHO:</strong> Who is involved? Who is speaking? Who is affected?</li>
                <li><strong>WHAT:</strong> What happened? What is the main idea? What are the key facts?</li>
                <li><strong>WHERE:</strong> Where did it happen? Where is the location?</li>

            <p>Today we will sharpen our listening skills by focusing on specific vocabulary and filling in missing words. This is called "cloze listening."</p>
            <p><strong>What is Cloze Listening?</strong> Cloze listening means listening carefully to fill in blank spaces in a text. This helps us focus on individual words and their meanings.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Activity:</strong> We will listen to a passage about "The Water Cycle." Some words will be missing from your paper. You must listen carefully to fill them in.</p>
            <p><strong>Listening for Vocabulary:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listen for content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives)</li>
                <li>Pay attention to word endings (-ing, -ed, -s)</li>
                <li>Notice sequence words (first, next, then, finally)</li>
                <li>Identify descriptive words that give details</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Read the sentences with blanks BEFORE listening. This gives you clues about what type of word is missing (a thing, an action, a description).</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Good listeners catch important words even when there's background noise or distractions.</p>

                <p>If the blank comes after "the" or "a," it's probably a noun. If it comes after "is" or "was," it might be an adjective. Example: "The sun is ______" needs a descriptive word like "hot" or "bright."</p>
