            <p>Welcome to our study of tools! Today we will learn about tools that change the shape of materials and tools that help us check if our work is accurate.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Look at this piece of wood. Which tools could we use to change its shape or size?</p>
            <p><strong>Cutting Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saws:</strong> Used to cut materials to length</li>
                <li><strong>Planes:</strong> Used to smooth surfaces and reduce thickness</li>
                <li><strong>Chisels:</strong> Used to carve out small sections and create joints</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Testing Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Try Square:</strong> Used to check if a corner is exactly 90° (perfectly square)</li>
                <li><strong>Spirit Level:</strong> Used to check if a surface is perfectly horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why accuracy matters:</strong> When building or making things, accurate measurements and square corners ensure that pieces fit together properly and structures are strong.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn about tools that help us join materials together and hold them securely while we work. Good tools make building safer and more precise.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> How do we keep two pieces of wood together while the glue dries?</p>
            <p><strong>Holding Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>G‑clamps and Sash Clamps:</strong> Used to squeeze pieces together tightly</li>
                <li><strong>Bench Vice:</strong> Holds material firmly to a workbench so both hands are free to work</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Driving Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hammers:</strong> Used with metal nails to join materials</li>
                <li><strong>Mallets:</strong> Made of wood or rubber; used for hitting chisels or assembling wood joints without damaging surfaces</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Building Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trowel:</strong> Used for spreading mortar or cement between bricks</li>
                <li><strong>Building Square:</strong> A large square used to check that walls are built at right angles</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety Note:</strong> Never use a metal hammer on a wooden chisel—use a mallet instead. Using the wrong tool can damage the tool or the material, and can be dangerous.</p>
