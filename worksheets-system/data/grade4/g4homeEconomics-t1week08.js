            <p>Welcome to our lesson on healthy eating! Today we will learn about the Zambia Food Based Dietary Guidelines using a special shape - the pyramid.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The food pyramid helps us understand which foods we should eat more of and which we should eat less of to stay healthy and strong.</p>
            <p><strong>Why a Pyramid?</strong> The bottom of the pyramid is wider than the top. Foods at the bottom are those we should eat the most of. Foods at the top are those we should eat the least of.</p>
            <p><strong>The Zambian Food Pyramid:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Base Level (Eat Most):</strong> Staples like Nshima, cereals, and other grains. These give us energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Level:</strong> Vegetables and fruits. These give us vitamins and keep us healthy.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Level:</strong> Proteins (beans, fish, meat, eggs) and dairy (milk, yogurt). These help us grow and build strong bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Level (Eat Least):</strong> Fats, oils, and sugars. These should be eaten in small amounts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Following the Zambia Food Based Dietary Guidelines helps us grow properly, stay healthy, and have energy for learning and playing.</p>

            <p>Today we will use what we learned about the food pyramid to create balanced, healthy meals for ourselves and our families.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> If your plate only has Nshima on it, is it balanced? Why not?</p>
            <p><strong>What is a Balanced Meal?</strong> A balanced meal contains foods from different food groups that give our bodies all the nutrients they need.</p>
            <p><strong>The Balanced Plate Rule:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Half the plate:</strong> Vegetables and fruits</li>
                <li><strong>One quarter:</strong> Starchy foods (like Nshima, rice, or potatoes)</li>
                <li><strong>One quarter:</strong> Protein foods (like beans, fish, or meat)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Balance Matters:</strong> Eating balanced meals helps us get all the different nutrients our bodies need to grow, learn, and stay healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional Zambian Meals Can Be Balanced!</strong> We can make our traditional foods healthier by making sure we include enough vegetables and protein with our Nshima.</p>
