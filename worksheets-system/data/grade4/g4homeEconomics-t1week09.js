            <p>Welcome to our lesson on healthy eating habits! Today we will learn about how much food we should eat to keep our bodies healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Eating the right amount of food is just as important as eating the right kinds of food.</p>
            <p><strong>What is a Serving Size?</strong> A serving size is the recommended amount of food to eat at one time. It's like a "food guideline" for healthy eating.</p>
            <p><strong>What is a Portion Size?</strong> A portion size is the amount of food you actually choose to put on your plate and eat.</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps us maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Gives our bodies the right amount of energy</li>
                <li>Prevents us from eating too much or too little</li>
                <li>Helps us get all the nutrients we need</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> How do you decide how much Nshima or relish to put on your plate? Do you think about how much you need, or just what you want?</p>
            <p>When we control our portion sizes, we help our bodies stay healthy and strong!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn a fun and easy way to measure food without using scales or measuring cups!</p>
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Do you always have a scale or measuring cup when you're eating? Probably not! That's why we can use our hands as measuring tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Handy Measures:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A Fist:</strong> Use your closed fist to measure portions of carbohydrates like rice, Nshima, or potatoes. One fist is about one serving.</li>
                <li><strong>A Thumb:</strong> Use your thumb to measure fats or oils like cooking oil, butter, or peanut butter. One thumb is about one serving.</li>
                <li><strong>The Palm:</strong> Use your palm (without fingers) to measure protein portions like meat, chicken, or fish. One palm is about one serving.</li>
                <li><strong>A Handful:</strong> Use your cupped hand to measure snacks like nuts, chips, or fruit pieces.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The Half-Plate Rule:</strong> Fill half your plate with vegetables or salad. This helps you get enough vitamins and minerals.</p>
            <p><strong>Why These Measures Are Useful:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You always have your hands with you!</li>
                <li>Hand sizes grow with your body</li>
                <li>Easy to remember and use at home</li>
                <li>Helps you make healthy choices anywhere</li>
