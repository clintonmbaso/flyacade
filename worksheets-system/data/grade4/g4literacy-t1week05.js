            <p>Welcome to our exploration of non-traditional reading materials! Today we'll discover how reading can be fun and informative through magazines, blogs, and other media.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Reading isn't just about books! Many different types of texts can teach us new things and spark our curiosity.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Non-Traditional Texts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magazines:</strong> Articles on specific topics like science, animals, or hobbies</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Blogs:</strong> Online writings by people sharing their knowledge or experiences</li>
                <li><strong>News Articles:</strong> Current events and important happenings</li>
                <li><strong>Instructional Texts:</strong> How-to guides, recipes, or craft instructions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why explore different texts?</strong> Different reading materials help us learn about the world in various ways and can make reading more enjoyable and relevant to our interests!</p>

            <p><strong>Sharing Circle Protocol:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be a Good Listener:</strong> Pay attention when others are sharing</li>
                <li><strong>Be Clear:</strong> Speak loudly enough for everyone to hear</li>
                <li><strong>Be Respectful:</strong> Wait your turn without interrupting</li>
                <li><strong>Be Curious:</strong> Ask questions about others' discoveries</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Media Literacy Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider the source - who wrote this and why?</li>
                <li>Check the date - is this information current?</li>
                <li>Look for evidence - are facts supported by examples or research?</li>
                <li>Compare sources - do other texts say the same thing?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important Fact:</strong> Different types of texts have different purposes. Some inform, some persuade, some entertain, and some do all three!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose a comfortable reading spot</li>
                <li>Read silently for the full reading period</li>
                <li>Stay focused on your own book</li>

                <li>Be prepared to share about your reading</li>
            </ol>

                <li>What are you reading about?</li>

                <li>What questions do you have about the story?</li>
