            <p>Welcome to Week 2 of Social Studies! This week, we are going to learn about families—who is in them and how they are related to us.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Let's begin by thinking about the people you live with or see often. Who makes up your family at home?</p>
            <p><strong>Family Members We Will Learn:</strong> Here are some common family terms you might already know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Father (Dad)</li>
                <li>Mother (Mom)</li>
                <li>Brother</li>
                <li>Sister</li>
                <li>Uncle</li>
                <li>Auntie (or Aunt)</li>
                <li>Cousin</li>
                <li>Grandparents (Grandma & Grandpa)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Understanding Relationships:</strong> Sometimes family members are connected through parents. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your mother’s brother is your uncle.</li>
                <li>Your father’s sister is your auntie.</li>
                <li>Your uncle or auntie’s children are your cousins.</li>
                <li>Your parents’ parents are your grandparents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Families Matter:</strong> Families help us feel loved, safe, and supported. Knowing who our family members are helps us understand our own story and background.</p>

                <p>A family tree starts with grandparents at the top, then parents, then children. It helps us see how everyone is connected.</p>

            <p>Welcome back! Today, we will learn that families come in many different shapes and sizes—and all of them are important.</p>
            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> Let's quickly review the family members we talked about on Monday.</p>
            <p><strong>Different Family Structures:</strong> Families can be organized in different ways. Here are some common types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Family:</strong> A family that includes only parents and their children.</li>
                <li><strong>Extended Family:</strong> A family that includes not only parents and children but also other relatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins living together or nearby.</li>
                <li><strong>Single-Parent Family:</strong> A family where one parent raises the child or children.</li>
                <li><strong>Child-Headed or Guardian-Headed Family:</strong> A family where children live with an older sibling, another relative, or a legal guardian instead of parents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> No family type is better than another. What makes a family strong is love, care, and support. Every family is unique and special in its own way.</p>
            <p><strong>Respect and Understanding:</strong> It's important to respect all family types. We should never make someone feel their family is “less than” because it looks different from ours.</p>
