            <p>Welcome to Week 4 of Social Studies! This week we will learn about the important roles each family member plays at home.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Every home has work that needs to be done to keep the family happy, healthy, and organized. Today we will explore who does what in a family.</p>
            <p><strong>Why are family roles important?</strong> When everyone helps, the home runs smoothly and family members feel supported and valued.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Questions to Think About:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who cooks in your home?</li>
                <li>Who makes sure there is food and other needs?</li>
                <li>Who helps keep the home clean and tidy?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common Household Roles:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fending for the family (providing food, shelter, clothing)</li>
                <li>Cooking meals</li>
                <li>Washing clothes and dishes</li>
                <li>Sweeping and cleaning</li>
                <li>Watering plants and gardening</li>
                <li>Taking care of younger siblings</li>
                <li>Raking compound and picking litter</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Family Teamwork:</strong> In most families, parents often handle providing and major tasks, while children help with lighter chores. Everyone's contribution matters!</p>

            <p><strong>Recap:</strong> In our last lesson, we identified different roles family members play. Today, we put that into action!</p>
            <p><strong>Why perform your role?</strong> Doing your part shows love, responsibility, and teamwork. It helps your family and teaches you important life skills.</p>

                <li>Tidying your room</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Always ask an adult for help if you are unsure how to do a task safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step Example – Raking:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Get a rake that is the right size for you.</li>

                <li>Return the rake to its proper place.</li>
