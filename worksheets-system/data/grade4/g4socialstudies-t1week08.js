            <p>Welcome to Week 8 of Social Studies! This week, we’re going beyond the four main directions to learn how to describe locations even more accurately.</p>
            <p><strong>Warm-up Review:</strong> Let’s review the four cardinal points. Can everyone point toward North, South, East, and West?</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Question:</strong> "What do we call the direction that is exactly halfway between North and East?"</p>
            <p><strong>Introducing Inter-Cardinal Points:</strong> When we combine two cardinal directions, we get four new points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Northeast (NE)</strong> – halfway between North and East</li>
                <li><strong>Northwest (NW)</strong> – halfway between North and West</li>
                <li><strong>Southeast (SE)</strong> – halfway between South and East</li>
                <li><strong>Southwest (SW)</strong> – halfway between South and West</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Inter-cardinal points help us give clearer, more precise directions. Instead of saying “It’s kind of north and east,” we can say “It’s northeast!”</p>
            <p><strong>Visual Aid:</strong> We’ll expand our compass rose on the board to include all eight directions.</p>

            <p>Today, we’re putting our direction skills to the test! We’ll use both cardinal and inter-cardinal points to navigate a community map.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction Scenario:</strong> Imagine a delivery driver is lost in our community. How can we use our map skills to give them perfect directions?</p>
            <p><strong>Teacher Activity:</strong> We’ll look at a shared "Classroom Community Map" on the board with various landmarks: school, post office, library, park, fire station, market, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Pair Activity – "Locate the Treasure":</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Work with a partner.</li>
                <li>Student A chooses a building on the map.</li>
                <li>Student B must describe its location using the correct cardinal or inter-cardinal points <strong>from a starting point</strong> (e.g., "The library is southwest of the post office").</li>
                <li>Switch roles after three turns each.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Real-World Connection:</strong> Knowing how to use directions helps pilots, hikers, sailors, and even people using GPS on their phones. It’s a life skill!</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Clear directions keep people safe, save time, and help communities run smoothly.</p>
