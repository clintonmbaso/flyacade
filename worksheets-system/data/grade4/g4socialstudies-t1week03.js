            <p>Welcome to Week 3 of Social Studies! Today we will learn how to build strong family relationships through empathy.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Empathy?</strong> Empathy means feeling what someone else feels. It's different from sympathy, which means feeling sorry for someone's troubles. Empathy helps us understand each other better.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is Empathy Important?</strong> When we show empathy, we make our family members feel understood, supported, and loved. This makes our family bonds stronger!</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Focus:</strong> We will learn practical ways to show empathy and kindness in our families.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do you feel when someone shows you kindness?</li>
                <li>What can you do when a family member is sad or tired?</li>
                <li>How does showing empathy make a family stronger?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Welcome back! Today we will learn about family values—the rules and beliefs that guide how we behave in our families.</p>
            <p><strong>What are Family Values?</strong> Values are important ideas that help families work together happily. They are like the "glue" that holds a family together.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Family Values:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respect</strong> – Listening to elders, using polite words, and honoring each other's feelings.</li>
                <li><strong>Honesty</strong> – Telling the truth even when it's hard.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> – Doing your chores, homework, and helping without being asked.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness</strong> – Sharing toys, time, and treats equally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Values Matter:</strong> When everyone in a family practices these values, the home becomes a happier, safer, and more loving place.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Challenge:</strong> Think about which value you want to practice more at home this week!</p>
