            <p>Welcome to our woodworking unit. Today we will learn about the most important piece of furniture in a woodworking shop – the work bench.</p>
            <p><strong>Why We Need a Special Table:</strong> We can't use a regular desk or kitchen table for woodworking. We need a strong, stable surface that can handle hammering, sawing, and other tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Parts of a Work Bench:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Top:</strong> A thick, flat surface made of hard wood that can withstand hammering and sawing without getting damaged.</li>
                <li><strong>The Legs:</strong> Heavy-duty support legs that keep the bench from wobbling or tipping over while you work.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bench Vice:</strong> A special clamp attached to the bench that acts like a "third hand" to hold wood tightly while you saw, drill, or hammer.</li>
                <li><strong>The Well:</strong> A recessed area or trough at the back of the bench to keep tools from rolling onto the floor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Each part of the work bench helps keep you safe. The sturdy top prevents tools from bouncing, the legs prevent tipping, the vice holds wood securely, and the well keeps tools organized.</p>

                <p>A proper work bench is usually made from thick hardwood like maple or beech. It's much heavier and stronger than a regular table.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn one of the most important rules in woodworking: "Measure twice, cut once." Accurate measuring and marking prevents mistakes and waste.</p>
            <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Always measure carefully and mark clearly before cutting any material. A small mistake in measuring can ruin your entire project.</p>
            <p><strong>Measuring Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steel Rule:</strong> Used for measuring short distances (up to 30cm). It's rigid and won't bend, giving you accurate measurements.</li>
                <li><strong>Measuring Tape:</strong> Used for measuring longer distances. The tape extends and retracts, and can measure several meters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Marking Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scriber:</strong> A sharp pointed tool for marking lines on metal. It scratches a thin, precise line.</li>
                <li><strong>Marking Knife:</strong> A small knife with a sharp point for making precise lines on wood. It cuts the wood fibers for cleaner edges.</li>
                <li><strong>Marking Gauge:</strong> A tool for drawing lines parallel to the edge of wood. It has an adjustable fence and a sharp point or blade.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Accuracy Matters:</strong> If your measurements are wrong, pieces won't fit together properly. Clear marking helps you cut exactly where you need to.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-ruler" style="color: #FF6B6B;"></i> Steel Rule Example</div>
                <p>A steel rule is usually 15cm or 30cm long. It's perfect for measuring small pieces of wood for joints or details.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-ruler-combined"></i> Marking Knife Example</div>
                <p>A marking knife makes a thin cut along the wood grain. This helps saws and chisels follow the line exactly, resulting in cleaner cuts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-drafting-compass"></i> Marking Gauge Example</div>
                <p>The marking gauge has a wooden or metal body with a sharp spur. You slide the fence to your measurement, then run it along the wood edge to mark a parallel line.</p>
