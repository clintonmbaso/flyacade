            <p>Welcome to our exploration of food! Today we will learn how to classify foods based on where they come from and what nutrients they provide.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> All foods can be grouped into categories based on their nutritional content. Understanding these groups helps us make healthy eating choices.</p>
            <p><strong>Six Main Food Groups:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cereals/Tubers:</strong> Rice, maize, wheat, potatoes, yams (provide carbohydrates for energy)</li>
                <li><strong>Meat/Fish/Insects:</strong> Beef, chicken, fish, termites (provide proteins for growth and repair)</li>
                <li><strong>Pulses/Nuts:</strong> Beans, lentils, groundnuts, almonds (provide proteins and healthy fats)</li>
                <li><strong>Dairy:</strong> Milk, cheese, yogurt (provide calcium for strong bones and teeth)</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Spinach, carrots, onions, tomatoes (provide vitamins and minerals)</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Oranges, bananas, mangoes, apples (provide vitamins and fiber)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Core Nutrients Found in Foods:</strong> Proteins, Carbohydrates, Fats, Vitamins, and Minerals.</p>
