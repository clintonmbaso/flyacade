        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to Phase 2 of our intensive reading journey! Today we will focus on building our vocabulary by learning how to use context clues to understand new words in a text.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Context clues are hints that an author gives to help define a difficult or unusual word. These clues can be found in the words, phrases, or sentences that surround the unknown word.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Context Clues:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition Clues:</strong> The author explains the word's meaning right in the sentence</li>
                <li><strong>Example Clues:</strong> The author gives examples that help explain the word</li>
                <li><strong>Synonym Clues:</strong> The author uses a similar word nearby</li>
                <li><strong>Antonym Clues:</strong> The author uses an opposite word to show contrast</li>
                <li><strong>Inference Clues:</strong> You have to use the situation to figure out the meaning</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is vocabulary important?</strong> A strong vocabulary helps you understand what you read, express your ideas clearly, and become a better communicator.</p>

                <p>Emma discovered a <strong>dilapidated</strong> gate at the back of her new yard. The wooden slats were broken and hanging loosely from rusty hinges. Behind it lay a garden that had been <strong>neglected</strong> for years. Weeds grew tall where flowers once bloomed, and the stone path was cracked and covered in moss. Despite its <strong>disheveled</strong> appearance, Emma saw potential. She imagined restoring it to its former <strong>glory</strong>, when it must have been beautiful and well-kept.</p>
                <p>In the center stood a <strong>peculiar</strong> statue of a frog wearing a crown. It was strange and unusual compared to normal garden decorations. Emma decided this would be her secret project – to <strong>revitalize</strong> the garden and bring it back to life.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will practice direct comprehension skills by answering literal questions about a text. Literal questions are those where the answers are directly stated in the passage.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Direct comprehension means understanding exactly what the text says. You don't need to guess or infer – the answer is right there in the words.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Literal Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Who:</strong> Questions about characters or people</li>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Questions about events or things</li>
                <li><strong>Where:</strong> Questions about places</li>
                <li><strong>When:</strong> Questions about time</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> Questions about processes or methods (when directly stated)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Finding Direct Answers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for keywords from the question in the text</li>
                <li>Read carefully – answers are often in the same sentence or nearby</li>
                <li>Sometimes you need to combine information from different sentences</li>
                <li>Always check your answer by finding the evidence in the text</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is direct comprehension important?</strong> It's the foundation of all reading. If you can't understand what the text directly says, you can't make inferences or analyze deeper meanings.</p>

                <p>Maple Elementary School held its annual fair last Saturday from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM in the school playground. The student council, led by president Maya Rodriguez, had been planning the event for two months. This year's theme was "Under the Sea," so blue and green decorations covered the playground.</p>
                <p>There were fifteen different game booths, including ring toss, bean bag throw, and fishing for prizes. The food stand sold hot dogs, popcorn, and lemonade. A ticket cost 25 cents, and most games required two tickets to play.</p>
                <p>The most popular attraction was the cake walk, where winners received homemade cakes donated by parents. By the end of the day, the fair had raised $850 for new library books. Principal Johnson announced that next year's fair would be even bigger.</p>

            <p>Today we will develop our inferential thinking skills by answering "Why" and "How" questions that require us to read between the lines of a story.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Inferential thinking means using clues from the text plus your own knowledge to understand what the author implies but doesn't directly state.</p>

            <ul>
