            <p>Welcome to Week 9 of Social Studies! Today we are going to learn about something very important that belongs to every person in the world: <strong>Human Rights</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction Activity:</strong> Let's think about what things we absolutely need to live a happy and healthy life. What comes to your mind?</p>
            <p><strong>What are Human Rights?</strong> These are basic things that every person is entitled to, no matter who they are or where they live. They are not privileges—they are rights we are born with.</p>
            <p><strong>Today's Core Rights:</strong> We will focus on five very important human rights:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Right to Life:</strong> Every person has the right to live safely and freely.</li>
                <li><strong>The Right to Food:</strong> Everyone should have enough healthy food to eat.</li>
                <li><strong>The Right to Health:</strong> We all deserve access to doctors, medicine, and clean water.</li>
                <li><strong>The Right to Education:</strong> Every child should be able to go to school and learn.</li>
                <li><strong>The Right to Shelter:</strong> Everyone needs a safe place to live and sleep.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why do these rights matter?</strong> They help us grow, stay safe, and reach our full potential. For example, education helps us become whatever we dream of!</p>

            <p>Welcome back! Today we’ll learn that with rights come <strong>responsibilities</strong>. We’ll also learn how to help if someone’s rights are not being respected.</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> Let’s remember the five human rights we learned on Monday. Who can name one?</p>
            <p><strong>Rights and Responsibilities:</strong> If we have a right to education, what is our responsibility in the classroom? (Listen, participate, respect others.) Every right has a matching responsibility.</p>
            <p><strong>What is a Rights Abuse?</strong> This is when someone is prevented from having their basic needs or rights met. Examples: a child not allowed to go to school, someone not having enough food, or a person living in unsafe conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>How Can We Help?</strong> It’s important to know who to talk to if you see or experience a rights abuse. Safe, responsible adults can help:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents or guardians</li>
                <li>Teachers or school counselors</li>
                <li>Trusted family members</li>
                <li>Community leaders</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Reporting Matters:</strong> Speaking up helps protect people and make sure everyone is treated fairly and kindly.</p>
