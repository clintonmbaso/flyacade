            <p>Welcome to Week 10! This week we are learning about citizenship and patriotism. Today we will explore what it means to be a patriot.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Look at this picture of our national flag. How does it make you feel? What about when you hear our national anthem? These are symbols of our country.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Word:</strong> <strong>Patriotism</strong> means showing love and devotion to one’s country.</p>
            <p><strong>Teacher Explanation:</strong> Being a patriot isn’t just about symbols like flags or songs. It’s about participating in activities that make our country better. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protecting the environment by not littering</li>
                <li>Helping in community clean‑up events</li>
                <li>Being kind and respectful to others</li>
                <li>Learning about our country’s history and values</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Think About It:</strong> Patriots care about their country’s future. They act in ways that keep it safe, clean, and fair for everyone.</p>

            <p>Today we continue our study of citizenship by learning about duties and obligations.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Just as we have rights—like the right to education and safety—we also have <strong>obligations</strong> or duties. These are things we must do to keep our community safe, clean, and fair.</p>
            <p><strong>Teacher Explanation:</strong> Let’s look at some important duties of citizens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voting:</strong> When you are old enough, voting helps choose leaders and make decisions for the community.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting the Environment:</strong> This includes not littering, recycling, and conserving water and energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting Crime or Dangerous Activities:</strong> Telling a trusted adult or authority if you see something wrong helps keep everyone safe.</li>
                <li><strong>Following Laws and Rules:</strong> Laws exist to protect people and ensure fairness.</li>
                <li><strong>Participating in Community Life:</strong> Joining clean‑ups, helping neighbors, or learning about local issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Even though you are not yet old enough to vote, you can still practice many of these duties today!</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Good citizens don’t just enjoy their rights—they also take responsibility for making their community better.</p>
