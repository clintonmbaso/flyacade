            <p>Welcome to our lesson on measuring tools in cooking and baking. Today we will learn how to use different equipment to measure ingredients correctly.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Using the right measuring tool helps us get accurate amounts of ingredients, which is important for recipes to turn out well.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Measuring Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Measuring Cups:</strong> Used for both liquid and dry ingredients</li>
                <li><strong>Measuring Spoons:</strong> Used for small amounts of ingredients (tablespoon, teaspoon)</li>
                <li><strong>Kitchen Scales:</strong> Used to weigh ingredients in grams or kilograms</li>
                <li><strong>Measuring Jugs:</strong> Used mainly for liquids like milk or water</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Liquid vs. Dry Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liquids:</strong> Milk, water, oil - measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL)</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Ingredients:</strong> Flour, sugar, mealie meal - measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Measuring Matters:</strong> If we use too much or too little of an ingredient, our food might not taste right or bake properly.</p>

                <p>When measuring milk for a recipe, we would use a measuring jug marked in milliliters. 250mL is about one cup of liquid.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-weight"></i> Dry Ingredient Example</div>
                <p>When measuring flour for bread, we can use measuring cups or a kitchen scale. One level cup of flour weighs about 125 grams.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn how to convert between different measuring units and practice weighing ingredients accurately.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Many recipes use "handy measures" like cups and spoons, but these can be converted to exact metric measurements.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Conversions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup = 250 milliliters (mL) for liquids</li>
                <li>1 cup of flour = approximately 125 grams (g)</li>
                <li>1 cup of sugar = approximately 200 grams (g)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon = 15 milliliters (mL)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon = 5 milliliters (mL)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Kitchen Scales:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place an empty bowl on the scale</li>
                <li>Press the "tare" or "zero" button to reset to 0</li>
                <li>Add your ingredient until you reach the desired weight</li>
                <li>Read the display carefully - it shows the weight in grams or kilograms</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Accuracy Matters:</strong> Baking especially needs exact measurements. Too much or too little of certain ingredients can cause recipes to fail.</p>

                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-exchange-alt" style="color: #8B4513;"></i> Conversion Example</div>
                <p>If a recipe calls for 2 cups of milk, that's the same as 500mL (because 1 cup = 250mL, so 2 cups = 500mL).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Weighing Example</div>
                <p>When a recipe says "250g of flour," you would use a kitchen scale to measure exactly 250 grams, not just guess with a cup.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-cookie"></i> Baking Example</div>
                <p>Baking powder needs to be measured exactly. Too little and cakes won't rise; too much and they might taste bitter.</p>
