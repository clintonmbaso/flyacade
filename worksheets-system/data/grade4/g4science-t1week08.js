            <p>Welcome to our study of healthy eating! Today we will learn about the importance of eating balanced portions from all food groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Apportionment means eating the right amounts of different foods to create a balanced diet.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is Portion Control Important?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our bodies need different nutrients from different food groups</li>
                <li>Eating too much of one food group can mean missing nutrients from others</li>
                <li>Proper portions help us maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Balanced meals give us energy throughout the day</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is a Healthy Plate?</strong> Imagine your plate divided into sections for different food groups. Each section should be the right size for that type of food.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> A healthy diet requires balance and variety, not just eating one type of food!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how different people need different types of diets based on their activities, age, and health.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> Need more protein and carbohydrates for energy and muscle repair</li>
                <li><strong>Growing Children:</strong> Need calcium and protein for bone and muscle growth</li>
                <li><strong>Sick People:</strong> Might need special foods that are easy to digest or rich in certain vitamins</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly People:</strong> Often need fewer calories but more of certain nutrients</li>

            <p>Today we will learn about the complete picture of healthy living - not just food, but exercise, hydration, and understanding our bodies!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts for Healthy Living:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI):</strong> A tool that uses height and weight to estimate if someone is underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drinking enough water daily (about 6-8 glasses for children)</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity (at least 60 minutes daily for children)</li>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Combining good nutrition with activity and rest</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Understanding BMI:</strong> BMI is just one tool - it doesn't tell the whole story about health. Muscle weighs more than fat, so athletes might have a higher BMI but still be very healthy!</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Healthy living is about making good choices every day - what we eat, how we move, and how we take care of our bodies!</p>
