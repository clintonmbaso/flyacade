            <p>Welcome to our drama unit! Today we will learn how to use language to help others by stepping into different characters.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Role-playing helps us understand others' feelings and practice helpful language in a safe way.</p>
            <p><strong>What is a "Friend in Need"?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A friend who is sad, hurt, or having a problem</li>
                <li>Someone who needs support or assistance</li>
                <li>A person who might feel alone or worried</li>
                <li>Anyone who could use a kind word or helpful action</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is helping language important?</strong> Using polite and caring words shows empathy and makes others feel supported. Good friends know how to offer help appropriately!</p>
