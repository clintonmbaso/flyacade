        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our exploration of the kitchen! Today we will learn about the kitchen as an important functional space in our homes and the equipment we use in it.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The kitchen is more than just a room—it's a workspace designed for preparing food, eating meals, and storing kitchen items safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Functions of the Kitchen:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Preparing meals using various equipment and utensils</li>
                <li><strong>Eating:</strong> A space where families often gather to share meals</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Keeping food, utensils, and equipment organized and safe</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Washing dishes and keeping the cooking area hygienic</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Traditional vs. Modern Equipment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Wood-fired stoves, clay pots, manual tools, open-fire cooking</li>
                <li><strong>Modern:</strong> Electric/gas cookers, refrigerators, microwaves, blenders</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Understanding kitchen functions and equipment helps us work safely, efficiently, and hygienically when preparing food.</p>

                <p>In the past, people cooked over open fires using clay pots and wood stoves. Food took longer to prepare but had unique flavors from fire cooking.</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn about the tools that make kitchen work easier, safer, and more efficient. Knowing how to use utensils properly is an important life skill.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Kitchen utensils are tools designed for specific tasks. Labor-saving devices help us complete kitchen work faster and with less effort.</p>
            <p><strong>Standard Kitchen Utensils:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saucepans & Pots:</strong> For boiling, simmering, and cooking liquids</li>
                <li><strong>Spoons & Spatulas:</strong> For stirring, flipping, and serving food</li>
                <li><strong>Knives:</strong> Different types for chopping, slicing, and peeling</li>
                <li><strong>Measuring Tools:</strong> Cups and spoons for accurate ingredient amounts</li>
                <li><strong>Mixing Bowls:</strong> For combining ingredients</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Labor-Saving Devices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mixers & Blenders:</strong> For blending, pureeing, and mixing ingredients quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Microwaves:</strong> For reheating and quick cooking</li>
                <li><strong>Food Processors:</strong> For chopping, slicing, and grating vegetables</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Kettles:</strong> For boiling water rapidly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Always use kitchen tools properly and with adult supervision. Keep knives sharp (dull knives are more dangerous!) and handle electrical devices with dry hands.</p>
