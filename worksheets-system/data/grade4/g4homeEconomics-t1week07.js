            <p>Welcome to our Home Economics lesson! Today we will learn how all the foods we eat belong to special "families" called food groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Think about what you ate for breakfast today. All foods fit into different groups that help us eat balanced meals.</p>
            <p><strong>The Six Food Groups of Zambia:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cereals, Starchy Roots, and Tubers:</strong> These give us energy for playing and studying. Examples: Maize/Nshima, cassava, rice, wheat.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> These help keep our bodies healthy and strong. Examples: Rape, pumpkin leaves, cabbage, tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> These protect us from getting sick. Examples: Mangoes, guavas, oranges, bananas.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish, Insects, and Animal Source Foods:</strong> These help build our muscles. Examples: Caterpillars, beef, tilapia, chicken, eggs.</li>
                <li><strong>Dairy:</strong> These make our bones and teeth strong. Examples: Milk, mabisi (sour milk), yogurt, cheese.</li>
                <li><strong>Legumes, Pulses, and Nuts:</strong> These help repair our bodies. Examples: Groundnuts, beans, cowpeas, soybeans.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Eating foods from all six groups helps us grow properly, stay healthy, and have energy for our daily activities.</p>

            <p>Today we will learn why different foods are important for our bodies. Just like a car needs the right fuel, our bodies need the right foods!</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Why do we need to eat? Food gives us energy to play, helps us grow, and keeps us healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>The Three Main Roles of Food:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Energy Foods (Go Foods):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These give us energy for playing, studying, and all our activities</li>
                        <li>Come from: Cereals, starchy roots, and tubers</li>
                        <li>Examples: Nshima, cassava, rice - these are our "fuel"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Body-Building Foods (Grow Foods):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These help build and repair our muscles and body parts</li>
                        <li>Come from: Fish, insects, animal foods, legumes, pulses, nuts, and dairy</li>
                        <li>Examples: Beef, beans, milk, groundnuts - these are our "building blocks"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Protective Foods (Glow Foods):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These support our immune system to fight off colds and sickness</li>
                        <li>Improve digestion and prevent long-term health problems</li>
                        <li>Come from: Fruits and vegetables</li>
                        <li>Examples: Mangoes, guavas, rape, pumpkin leaves - these are our "body shields"</li>
