            <p>Welcome to our exploration of drama! Today we will learn how to analyze simple plays and understand the messages they convey.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Every play has a theme or lesson that the writer wants to share with the audience.</p>
            <p><strong>What is a Theme?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main message or lesson of the story</li>
                <li>What the author wants us to learn or think about</li>
                <li>Often about important values like honesty, courage, or kindness</li>
                <li>Sometimes called the "moral of the story"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Activity Focus:</strong> We will watch/read a local folk-tale play and identify its theme. Folk tales often teach us about our culture, values, and community.</p>
