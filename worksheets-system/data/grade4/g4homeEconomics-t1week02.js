            <p>Welcome to our lesson on food hygiene! Today we will learn how to keep food safe and prevent it from spoiling, which helps keep our families healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept 1: Food Hygiene</strong><br>
            Food hygiene means keeping food clean and safe to eat. When we handle food properly, we prevent germs from making us sick.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept 2: Food Spoilage</strong><br>
            Food spoilage happens when bacteria (tiny germs) grow on food. Bacteria love warm, moist places! That's why we use refrigerators to keep food cold or sealed containers to keep germs out.</p>
            <p><strong>Signs of Spoiled Food:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strange smell</li>
                <li>Change in color</li>
                <li>Mold growing (fuzzy spots)</li>
                <li>Unusual texture (slimy or mushy)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Food Safety Matters:</strong> Eating spoiled food can cause stomach aches, vomiting, or serious illness. By handling food properly, we protect our health.</p>

                <p>Bacteria grow fastest between 40°F and 140°F. That's why we keep hot food hot and cold food cold!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn two very important skills: how to wash our hands properly and how to make water safe to drink. These habits protect us from getting sick.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept 1: Personal Hygiene</strong><br>
            Before we touch any food, we must wash our hands with soap and water. Germs on our hands can get into food and make people sick.</p>
            <p><strong>The 20-Second Rule:</strong> Wash your hands for 20 seconds (about the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice) to remove germs effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept 2: Water Treatment</strong><br>
            Not all water is safe to drink. Water can contain invisible germs that cause diseases. We can make water safe through different methods.</p>
            <p><strong>Methods to Make Water Safe:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Heating water until it bubbles for 1-3 minutes kills most germs</li>
                <li><strong>Chlorination:</strong> Adding a few drops of chlorine or bleach (specially made for water)</li>
                <li><strong>Using Ash:</strong> In some traditional methods, clean ash can help purify water</li>
                <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Passing water through a clean cloth or special filter</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> After boiling water, let it cool down safely in a clean, covered container.</p>
