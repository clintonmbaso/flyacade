            <p>Welcome to our lesson on preparing surfaces! Today we will learn how to get materials ready before applying a final finish like paint or polish.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Prepare Surfaces?</strong> A smooth surface ensures finishes look good, last longer, and protect properly. Rough surfaces can cause splinters, uneven coloring, or weak protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanding:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using sandpaper to smooth wood surfaces</li>
                <li>Different grades: coarse (rough) to fine (smooth)</li>
                <li>Always sand in the direction of the wood grain</li>
                <li>Cleaning the surface after sanding removes dust</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Grinding:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using abrasive tools to smooth rough metal edges</li>
                <li>Removes rust, sharp edges, or old finishes</li>
                <li>Safety gear is important (goggles, gloves)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Polishing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rubbing a surface to make it shiny and clean</li>
                <li>Can use cloth, special compounds, or machines</li>
                <li>Often done after sanding or grinding</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Proper preparation makes the finish job easier and gives better results!</p>

        lessonContent: `
            <p>Today we will learn how to apply different finishes to products and practice important safety rules. Finishes protect materials and make them look better.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Use Finishes?</strong> Finishes protect materials from water, sun, wear, and damage. They also add color and make surfaces easier to clean.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Finishes:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Varnish:</strong> Clear protective coating for wood. It doesn't change the color much but protects from scratches and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Paint:</strong> Adds color and protection. Can be used on wood, metal, or other materials. Needs primer sometimes.</li>
                <li><strong>Wax:</strong> Gives shine and some water resistance. Often used on furniture or floors. Needs reapplication over time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wear gloves to protect your hands</li>
                <li>Work in a well-ventilated area (open windows or outside)</li>
                <li>Handle brushes and tools carefully to avoid spills</li>
                <li>Wear safety goggles when spraying finishes</li>
                <li>Wash hands after working with finishes</li>
                <li>Store finishes properly, away from heat</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Apply thin, even coats. Let each coat dry completely before adding another. Follow the instructions on the product.</p>

                <p>A wooden picnic table might be coated with varnish to protect it from rain and sun. The varnish keeps the wood from rotting or fading.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <div class="example-title"><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Paint Example</div>
                <p>A metal fence is painted to prevent rust and make it look nice. Special metal paint sticks better and lasts longer outdoors.</p>
