            <p>Welcome to Week 5 of Social Studies! Today we will explore what two major world religions—Christianity and Islam—teach about family life.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Different religions provide guidance on how family members should treat each other. These teachings help families live together with respect and care.</p>
            <p><strong>Christian Teachings:</strong> Christianity has many lessons about family in the Bible. Here are some key teachings:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Honoring Parents:</strong> The Bible teaches children to honor and obey their parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Parental Love:</strong> Parents are told to love and care for their children, not to provoke them.</li>
                <li><strong>Marital Respect:</strong> Husbands and wives are called to love and respect each other.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Islamic Teachings:</strong> Islam also gives clear guidance on family life from the Quran and Hadith:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respect for Mothers:</strong> Islam teaches that paradise lies under the feet of mothers, showing high respect.</li>
                <li><strong>Providing for the Family:</strong> It is the duty of the father to provide for the household.</li>
                <li><strong>Kindness to Parents:</strong> Children must be kind and respectful to both parents throughout their lives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Both religions share common values like respect, kindness, and care within the family.</p>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Understanding these teachings helps us appreciate how religion shapes family values in our community and around the world.</p>

            <p>Today we continue exploring family teachings—this time in Hinduism and Zambian Traditional beliefs.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Religious and cultural beliefs shape how families live together. Let's see how Hinduism and Zambian traditions view the family.</p>
            <p><strong>Hindu Teachings:</strong> Hinduism has strong family values rooted in ancient texts and practices:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Joint Family System:</strong> It is common for extended family (grandparents, uncles, aunts) to live together and support one another.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect for Elders:</strong> Younger members show respect to elders through gestures like touching feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Hospitality (Atithi Devo Bhava):</strong> Guests are treated as gods, teaching families to be welcoming and generous.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Zambian Traditional Teachings:</strong> Zambian culture emphasizes community and ancestry:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extended Family:</strong> Family includes not just parents and children, but also cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.</li>
                <li><strong>Ancestral Respect:</strong> Honoring ancestors is important, often through rituals and storytelling.</li>
                <li><strong>Communal Living (Ubuntu):</strong> "I am because we are"—the idea that a person's identity comes from the community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Both traditions show that family is more than just parents and children—it includes the wider community and ancestors.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Understanding different religious and traditional teachings helps us respect the diverse ways families live in our community.</p>
