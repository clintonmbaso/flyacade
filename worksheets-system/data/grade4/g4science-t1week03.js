        lessonContent: `
            <p>Welcome to our exploration of the respiratory system! Today we will learn how air travels in and out of our lungs by creating models.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The respiratory system brings oxygen into our bodies and removes carbon dioxide. It includes the nose, windpipe, and lungs.</p>
            <p><strong>Path of Air During Inhalation:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Air enters through the nose or mouth</li>
                <li>Travels down the windpipe (trachea)</li>
                <li>Passes through bronchial tubes</li>
                <li>Reaches tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Path During Exhalation:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Carbon dioxide leaves the alveoli</li>
                <li>Travels back through bronchial tubes</li>
                <li>Moves up the windpipe</li>
                <li>Exits through the nose or mouth</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Every cell in your body needs oxygen to create energy. Without the respiratory system, our bodies couldn't get the oxygen they need to survive!</p>

                <li><strong>Influenza (Flu):</strong> A viral infection that can cause breathing difficulties</li>
                <li><strong>Asthma:</strong> A condition where airways become narrow and swollen, making breathing difficult</li>

            <p><strong>Causes and Prevention:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Germs:</strong> Many respiratory illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria</li>
                <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Things like pollen, dust, or pet dander can trigger breathing problems</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Dirty air can harm our lungs over time</li>
                <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco smoke is very harmful to the respiratory system</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Importance of Prevention:</strong> Many respiratory illnesses can be prevented with good habits like handwashing, vaccination, and avoiding smoke.</p>
