            <p>Welcome to our study of proverbs! Today we will explore what proverbs are and learn some common ones.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Proverbs are short, wise sayings that give advice or teach a lesson. They often use figurative language.</p>
            <p><strong>Literal vs. Figurative Meaning:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Literal meaning</strong> is what the words actually say</li>
                <li><strong>Figurative meaning</strong> is the hidden lesson or advice</li>
                <li>Proverbs usually have a figurative meaning that's more important than the literal words</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Today's Key Proverbs:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>"Actions speak louder than words" - What you do is more important than what you say</li>
                <li>"Two heads are better than one" - Working together solves problems better</li>
                <li>"Practice makes perfect" - Repeating something helps you get better at it</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why are proverbs important?</strong> They help us share wisdom and advice in a memorable way that has been passed down through generations.</p>
