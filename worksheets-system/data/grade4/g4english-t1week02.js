            <p>Welcome to our English conversation practice! Today we will learn how to share and ask for personal information politely.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> When meeting someone new, we share basic information about ourselves using complete sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Your age</li>
                <li>Where you live</li>
                <li>Other basic facts about you</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Polite Conversation Rules:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make eye contact when speaking</li>
                <li>Use "please" and "thank you"</li>
                <li>Listen when others are speaking</li>
                <li>Ask follow-up questions</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Sharing information helps us make friends and understand each other better. Good conversations make everyone feel comfortable!</p>

            <p>Today we will learn how to express our opinions politely and clearly. Everyone has different thoughts, and that's okay!</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> An opinion is what you think or believe about something. It's different from a fact.</p>
            <p><strong>Opinion Starters:</strong> These words help us share our thoughts politely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I think...</strong> (This is what I believe)</li>
                <li><strong>I believe...</strong> (This is what I feel is true)</li>
                <li><strong>In my view...</strong> (This is how I see it)</li>
                <li><strong>In my opinion...</strong> (This is my personal thought)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Giving Reasons:</strong> When you share an opinion, it's helpful to say why you think that way:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with an opinion starter</li>
                <li>State your opinion</li>
                <li>Give a reason using "because..."</li>
