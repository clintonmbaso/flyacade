            <p>Welcome to the exciting world of Technology Studies! Today we will explore what technology means and discover two main types of technology we use every day.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Technology is the use of knowledge, tools, and skills to solve problems and make our lives better. It includes both digital tools and physical tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Two Main Types of Technology:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>ICT (Information and Communication Technology):</strong> Digital tools that help us share information and communicate</li>
                <li><strong>D&T (Design & Technology):</strong> Physical tools and processes used to design and make things</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Examples of ICT Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computers, laptops, and tablets</li>
                <li>Smartphones and smart watches</li>
                <li>Televisions and radios</li>
                <li>Internet and email systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples of D&T Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hammers, saws, and screwdrivers</li>
                <li>Measuring tapes and rulers</li>
                <li>Ovens and stoves (for cooking technology)</li>
                <li>Building materials like wood, metal, and plastic</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Both types of technology help us solve problems, create new things, and improve our daily lives. Understanding them helps us become better problem-solvers!</p>
