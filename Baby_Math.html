                           <br>
2. Demonstration with Objects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Create a visual representation of addition, using 4 objects and adding 4 more to make 8. &quot;Look, we had 4, and now we're adding 4 more. 4 + 4 equals 8!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
3. Guided Practice:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provide children with their own objects and guide them through simple addition problems. &quot;Let's try it together. If you have 3 blocks and we add 5 more, how many blocks do we have?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Reinforcement and Conclusion (2 minutes):<br>
- Reinforce the concept by summarizing the activities. &quot;Today, we explored the number 8 with drawings, objects, and even added some together. Great job!&quot;<br>
- Conclude with positive reinforcement and encourage children to continue practicing.<br>
                           <br>
Extension (Optional):<br>
- Create additional addition problems with different objects for continued practice.<br>
- Introduce the concept of subtraction using objects, showing how to take away from a group.<br>
                           <br>
By combining visual representation, hands-on activities with objects, and introducing simple addition problems, this session aims to provide a holistic understanding of the number 8 and basic addition concepts for young learners.<br>
