      <div href="#" class="icon openPopup" data-content="<h6>Introduction (5 minutes):</h6>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Discussion on Desert Habitats:</strong> Begin by discussing the concept of desert habitats, describing them as hot, dry places with little water and vegetation. Use simple language like, 'A desert is a very dry and sandy place with lots of sunshine and very little water.'</li>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Explain that desert animals have unique features that help them survive in such harsh environments. Use examples like, 'Animals like camels, snakes, and lizards live in deserts. They have special adaptations, like humps to store water or scales to keep them from losing too much moisture.'</li>
</ol>

<h6>Examples of Animals in Desert Habitat:</h6>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camels:</strong> Camels are known as the 'ships of the desert' because of their ability to store water in their humps. They have long eyelashes and nostrils that can close to protect them from sandstorms. Camels are well adapted to survive in the extreme heat and lack of water in deserts.</li>
    <li><strong>Snakes:</strong> Desert snakes, like the rattlesnake, have specialized scales that help them retain moisture and blend in with the sandy surroundings. They are skilled hunters, using their venom to subdue prey and survive in the harsh desert environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Lizards:</strong> Desert lizards, such as the desert iguana, have adaptations like heat-resistant scales and the ability to burrow underground to escape the intense heat of the sun. They are also excellent climbers, using their strong limbs and tails to navigate rocky terrain.</li>
    <li><strong>Scorpions:</strong> Scorpions are nocturnal predators that thrive in desert habitats. They have hard exoskeletons and powerful pincers and stingers to catch prey and defend themselves against predators. Scorpions are well adapted to the arid conditions of the desert.</li>
    <li><strong>Desert Foxes:</strong> Desert foxes, like the fennec fox, have large ears that help dissipate heat and enhance their hearing to locate prey. They also have thick fur coats that provide insulation during cold desert nights. Desert foxes are agile hunters and scavengers, feeding on small rodents and insects.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Exercise Questions:</h6>
<ol>
    <li>What is a desert habitat?
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer: A desert habitat is a hot, dry place with little water and vegetation.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Can you name an animal that lives in a desert?
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How do camels survive in the desert?
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What special feature do desert snakes have to help them survive?

            <li><em>Answer: Scorpions.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How do desert lizards escape the heat of the sun?
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer: By burrowing underground or seeking shade.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Why are camels called the 'ships of the desert'?
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer: Because they can store water in their humps and are well adapted to survive in the desert.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What do desert foxes use their large ears for?
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer: To dissipate heat and enhance their hearing.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Can you name another animal that lives in a desert habitat?
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer: Students might name other desert animals like jackrabbits or desert tortoises.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is something new you learned about desert habitats today?
