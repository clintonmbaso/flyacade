                           </strong><br>
Grade Level: 4<br>
                           <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Learning Objectives:<br>
1. Explore the concept of expanded form and word form of numbers.<br>
2. Break down numbers into their constituent place values.<br>
3. Practice converting numbers between standard, expanded, and word form.<br>
                           <br>
Materials:<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
- Place value charts<br>
- Number cards (0-9)<br>
- Practice worksheets with numbers for conversion<br>
                           <br>
Lesson Plan:<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (10 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by asking students if they know different ways to represent numbers.<br>
2. Explain that this week, they will learn about two new ways to represent numbers: expanded form and word form.<br>
                           <br>
Expanded Form (15 minutes):<br>
1. Write a number on the board, such as 647, and ask students to break it down into its constituent place values (hundreds, tens, ones).<br>
2. Show them how to represent this number in expanded form, for example: 600 + 40 + 7.<br>
3. Discuss the significance of each part of the expanded form representation.<br>
                           <br>
Word Form (10 minutes):<br>
1. Explain that word form represents numbers in words, such as &quot;six hundred forty-seven&quot; for 647.<br>
2. Write numbers in standard form on the board and ask students to provide the word form for each.<br>
                           <br>
Practice and Conversion (10 minutes):<br>
1. Provide students with practice worksheets containing numbers to be converted between standard, expanded, and word form.<br>
2. Encourage them to work in pairs or individually.<br>
3. Circulate the classroom to assist and ensure the correct application of the concept.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the key points about expanded form and word form of numbers.<br>
2. Reinforce the idea that these representations help us better understand and communicate numerical information.<br>
                           <br>
Homework:<br>
Assign homework that includes practicing the conversion of numbers between standard, expanded, and word form.<br>
                           <br>
Assessment:<br>
Assess students' understanding through their ability to correctly convert numbers between standard, expanded, and word form during both class activities and homework assignments.<br>
