Lesson Plan:<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (10 minutes):<br>
1. Begin the lesson by briefly reviewing what natural numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, and prime numbers are. Ask students to recall the definitions.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1 - Identifying Numbers (20 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute number cards to students.<br>
2. Instruct students to take turns holding up a number card and identifying the type of number it is (natural, even, odd, or prime).<br>
3. Encourage discussion and explanations for their choices.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2 - Sorting Numbers (15 minutes):<br>
1. Write a mix of numbers on the whiteboard (include natural, even, odd, and prime numbers).<br>
2. Divide the class into groups and provide each group with cards labeled &quot;Natural,&quot; &quot;Even,&quot; &quot;Odd,&quot; and &quot;Prime.&quot;<br>
3. Have each group take turns placing the numbers on the board in the correct category.<br>
4. Discuss and verify the answers as a class.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3 - Worksheet (20 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute worksheets with a variety of numbers.<br>
2. Instruct students to categorize the numbers into the four groups (natural, even, odd, and prime).<br>
3. Circulate to assist and answer questions as students work on their worksheets.<br>
4. Review and discuss the worksheet answers as a class.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (10 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the key points of the lesson, emphasizing the differences between natural, even, odd, and prime numbers.<br>
2. Use the prime numbers chart or poster to reinforce prime numbers.<br>
3. Ask students if they have any questions or need further clarification.<br>
                           <br>
Assessment:<br>
Assess students' understanding through class participation, their ability to categorize numbers during activities, and their accuracy on the worksheet.<br>
                           <br>
Extension:<br>
For advanced students, you can introduce the concept of composite numbers and ask them to identify and explain the differences between prime and composite numbers.<br>
                           <br>
Homework:<br>
Assign a homework assignment that includes identifying and categorizing numbers (natural, even, odd, or prime) within a given range or from a book or magazine.<br>

      <div href="#" class="icon openPopup" data-content="<h6>Introduction:</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Let's start our lesson by quickly going over what we've learned so far. Can anyone tell me what natural numbers are? Remember, they are whole numbers starting from 1 and going on forever.</li>
  <li>Now, who can remind us what even numbers are? Even numbers are those that can be divided exactly by 2, like 2, 4, 6, and so on. What about odd numbers? They're numbers that cannot be divided exactly by 2, like 1, 3, 5, and so forth.</li>
  <li>Finally, what are prime numbers? They are special numbers greater than 1 that have only two distinct factors: 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers because they can only be divided by 1 and themselves without leaving a remainder.</li>
</ol>

<h6>Explanation:</h6>
<p>For grade 3 students, let's explain each concept in simple terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Natural numbers</strong>: These are the numbers we use for counting things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. They start from 1 and go on forever.</li>
  <li><strong>Even numbers</strong>: These are numbers that can be paired up so that each pair adds up to 2. For example, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Odd numbers</strong>: These are numbers that don't have a partner to make 2 when paired up. For instance, 1, 3, 5, 7, and so forth.</li>
  <li><strong>Prime numbers</strong>: These are like the 'building blocks' of all numbers. They can't be made by multiplying other whole numbers together except for 1 and themselves. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Exercise Questions with Answers:</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Is 10 a prime number? Why or why not?<br>Answer: No, 10 is not a prime number because it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself (1, 2, 5, and 10).</li>
  <li>Write down the first five odd numbers.<br>Answer: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9</li>
  <li>Which is larger, 14 or 15? How do you know?<br>Answer: 15 is larger because it's not divisible by 2, whereas 14 is even, so it's smaller.</li>
  <li>Can you name an even number greater than 20?<br>Answer: Yes, 22 is an even number greater than 20.</li>
  <li>Is 1 a prime number? Why or why not?<br>Answer: No, 1 is not a prime number because it only has one factor, which is itself.</li>
  <li>Write down the next three prime numbers after 13.<br>Answer: 17, 19, 23</li>
  <li>How many factors does the number 7 have?<br>Answer: Two factors, 1 and 7.</li>
  <li>Is 25 an even number? Why or why not?<br>Answer: No, 25 is not an even number because it can't be divided exactly by 2.</li>
